  GENERAL INFORMATION    

 
 
  Place, Date and Time        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders ("Annual Meeting") will be held at the Heard Museum, 2301 North
Central Avenue, Phoenix, Arizona 85004-1323, at 10:30&nbsp;a.m., Mountain Standard Time, on Wednesday, May&nbsp;18, 2011. 

 
 
  Notice of Internet Availability        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you elected to receive printed copies of the proxy materials in prior years, you will receive a Notice of
Internet Availability of Proxy Materials by mail (the "Internet Notice"). The Internet Notice will instruct you as to how you may access and review the proxy materials. If you received an Internet
Notice by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions included in the Internet Notice. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Internet Notice is first being sent to shareholders on or about April&nbsp;6, 2011. The proxy statement and the form of proxy relating to the Annual Meeting are first being made
available to shareholders on or about April&nbsp;6, 2011. 

 
 
  Record Date; Shareholders Entitled to Vote        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All shareholders at the close of business on March&nbsp;21, 2011 (the "record date") are entitled to vote at the
meeting. Each holder of outstanding Company common stock is entitled to one vote per share held as of the record date on all matters on which shareholders are entitled to vote, except for the election
of directors, in which case "cumulative" voting applies (see "Vote Required&nbsp;&#150; Election of directors" on page&nbsp;2 of this proxy statement). At the close of business on the
record date, there were 108,947,551&nbsp;shares of common stock outstanding. 

 
 
  Voting        




Vote
by Internet. The website address for Internet voting is on the Internet Notice. Internet voting is available 24&nbsp;hours a day. 

Vote
by telephone. The toll-free number for telephone voting is on your proxy card. Telephone voting is available 24&nbsp;hours a day. 


Vote
by mail. You may vote by mail by promptly marking, dating, signing and mailing a proxy card (a postage-paid envelope is provided for mailing in the United
States). 

Vote
in person. You may come to and vote at the Annual Meeting. If you hold your shares in street name, you must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the holder of
record if you wish to vote these shares at the meeting. 

If
you vote by telephone or Internet, DO NOT mail a proxy card. 




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
may change or revoke your vote at any time before the proxy is exercised by: filing with our Corporate Secretary either a notice of revocation or a signed proxy card bearing a later
date; re-voting by telephone; or re-voting by Internet. Your proxy will be suspended with respect to your shares if you attend the meeting in person and so request, although
attendance at the meeting will not by itself revoke a previously-granted proxy. 

-&nbsp;1&nbsp;-




 

Table of Contents

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your
vote is confidential. Only the following persons have access to your vote: election inspectors; individuals who help with processing and counting of votes; and persons who need
access for legal reasons. 

 
 
  Quorum        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock is necessary to
constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. In counting the votes to determine whether a quorum exists, shares that are entitled to vote but not voted at the direction of the beneficial owner (called
abstentions) and votes withheld by brokers in the absence of instructions from beneficial owners (called broker non-votes) will be counted for purposes of determining whether there is a
quorum. Shares owned by the Company are not considered outstanding or present at the meeting. 

 
 
  Vote Required        




Election
of directors. Individuals receiving the highest number of votes will be elected. The number of votes that a shareholder may, but is not required to, cast is
calculated by multiplying the number of shares of common stock owned by the shareholder, as of the record date, by the number of directors to be elected. Any shareholder may cumulate his or her votes
by casting them for any one nominee or by distributing them among two or more nominees. Abstentions will not be counted toward a nominee's total and will have no effect on the election of directors.
You may not cumulate your votes against a nominee. If you hold shares beneficially through a broker, trustee or other nominee and wish to cumulate votes, you should contact your broker, trustee or
nominee. If you would like to exercise your cumulative voting rights, you must do so by mail. The Company's Bylaws provide that, in an uncontested election, a director nominee who receives a greater
number of votes cast "withheld" for his or her election than "for" such election will promptly tender his or her resignation to the Corporate Governance Committee. The Corporate Governance Committee
is required to evaluate the resignation, taking into account the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and will recommend to the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") whether to
accept or reject the resignation. 

Under
the current rules of The New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), your broker is not able to vote on your behalf in any director election unless you give your broker specific voting instructions. We
encourage you to provide instructions so that your shares will be counted in the election of directors. 

Say-on-Pay
and frequency of Say-on-Pay. The votes cast "for" must exceed the votes cast "against" to approve the advisory
vote on the compensation disclosed in this proxy statement of our Named Executive Officers&nbsp;&#150; the Say-on-Pay vote. This vote is not intended to address any
specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of the Named Executive Officers and the compensation philosophy, policies and procedures described in this proxy statement. In
connection with the frequency of how often shareholders have an advisory Say-on-Pay vote, shareholders may vote for every 1, 2 or 3&nbsp;years or abstain. The frequency
receiving the greatest number of votes&nbsp;&#150; every 1, 2 or 3&nbsp;years&nbsp;&#150; will be considered the frequency approved by the shareholders. For both the
Say-on-Pay vote and the frequency vote, because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board or the Company. However, the Board will review the voting results and
take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation and the frequency of Say-on-Pay votes. Abstentions and broker non-votes
will have no effect on the outcome of these proposals. 

Ratification
of the appointment of the independent accountants. The votes cast "for" must exceed the votes cast "against" to ratify the appointment of the independent
accountants for the 



-&nbsp;2&nbsp;-




 

Table of Contents





year
ending December&nbsp;31, 2011. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. 


The
Board recommends a vote: 


&#149;FOR the election of the nominated slate of directors (Proposal 1); &#149;FOR the
approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our Named
Executive Officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement (Proposal 2);  &#149;FOR the option of every 3&nbsp;years for future
Say-on-Pay advisory votes (Proposal 3); and  &#149;FOR the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp;
Touche&nbsp;LLP ("D&amp;T") as the Company's independent accountants for the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2011 (Proposal 4). 



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Board is not aware of any other matters that will be brought before the shareholders for a vote. If any other matters properly come before the meeting, the proxy holders will vote
on those matters in accordance with the recommendations of the Board or, if no recommendations are given, in accordance with their own judgment. 


 
 
  Attendance at the Annual Meeting        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to attend the Annual Meeting, you will need to present a valid picture identification, such as a driver's
license or passport, and either: 



&#149;the Internet Notice or the top portion of your proxy card if you are a shareholder of record (each Internet Notice or
proxy card admits two people); or  &#149;a copy of a brokerage statement showing ownership of our stock if you hold your shares in street name. 


 
 
  Delivery of Annual Reports and Proxy Statements to a Shared Address; Obtaining a Copy of the Annual Report        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you and one or more shareholders share the same address, it is possible that only one Internet Notice, Annual
Report or proxy statement was delivered to your address. Registered shareholders at the same address who wish to receive separate copies of the Internet Notice, the Annual Report or proxy statement
may: 



&#149;call the Company's Shareholder Services at 1-602-250-5511;  &#149;mail a request to Shareholder Services at P.O.&nbsp;Box&nbsp;53999, Mail
Station 8602, Phoenix, AZ
85072-3999; or  &#149;e-mail a request to: shareholderdept@pinnaclewest.com. 


The
Company will promptly deliver to you the information requested. Shareholders who own Company stock through a broker and who wish to receive separate copies of the Internet Notice, Annual Report or
proxy statement should contact their broker. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
can access our Annual Report via the Internet. A copy of the Annual Report is available on the Company's website (www.pinnaclewest.com) and will be
provided to any shareholder upon request. Shareholders may request a copy from Shareholder Services at the telephone number or addresses set forth above or as described in the Internet Notice.

  Shareholder Proposals or Director Nominations for 2012 Annual Meeting        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be included in the proxy materials for the 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "2012 Annual Meeting"), any
shareholder proposal intended to be presented at that meeting must be received by our Corporate Secretary no later than December&nbsp;8, 2011 at the following address: 

Corporate
Secretary
Pinnacle West Capital Corporation
400 North Fifth Street, Mail Station 9068
Phoenix, Arizona 85004 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
shareholder who intends to present a proposal at the 2012 Annual Meeting, but does not wish it to be included in the 2012 proxy materials, must submit the proposal by the close of
business on February&nbsp;18, 2012, but not earlier than January&nbsp;19, 2012. Nominations for the Board must be received by November&nbsp;18, 2011. In all cases, shareholders must also comply
with the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and our Bylaws. 

 
 
  Proxy Solicitation        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is soliciting the enclosed proxy. The Company may solicit shareholders over the Internet, by telephone or by
mail. The Company has retained Georgeson&nbsp;Inc. to assist in the distribution of proxy solicitation materials and the solicitation of proxies for $10,000, plus customary expenses. The costs of
the solicitation will be paid by the Company. As required, the Company will reimburse brokerage houses and others for their out-of-pocket expenses in forwarding documents to
beneficial owners of stock. 

 
 
  INFORMATION ABOUT OUR BOARD AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE    

 
    Director Independence        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NYSE rules require companies whose securities are traded on the NYSE to have a majority of independent directors.
These rules describe certain relationships that prevent a director from being independent and require a company's board of directors to make director independence determinations in all other
circumstances. The Company's Board has also adopted Director Independence Standards to assist the Board in making independence determinations. These Director Independence Standards are available on
the Company's website at www.pinnaclewest.com. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
on the Board's review, the Board has determined that one of the Company's 12 directors is not independent and that 11 of the directors are independent. The 11 independent
directors are Messrs.&nbsp;Basha, Gallagher, Lopez, Nordstrom, and Parker, Drs. Cortese, Herberger and Klein, and Mses. Clark-Johnson, Grant and Munro. Mr.&nbsp;Brandt is not independent under the
NYSE rules or the Director Independence Standards because of his employment with the Company. Messrs.&nbsp;Jamieson, Post and Stewart retired from the Board in May 2010. Messrs.&nbsp;Jamieson and
Stewart were independent while on the Board. Mr.&nbsp;Post was not independent while on the Board due to his former employment with the Company. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
accordance with the NYSE rules and the Director Independence Standards, the Board undertakes an annual review to determine which of its directors are independent. The reviews
generally take place in the first quarter of each year; however, directors are required to notify the Company of any changes that occur throughout the year that may impact their independence. 

-&nbsp;4&nbsp;-




 

Table of Contents

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
considering the independence of Mr.&nbsp;Gallagher, the Board considered that the law firm of Gallagher&nbsp;&amp; Kennedy, P.A. ("Gallagher&nbsp;&amp; Kennedy"), where
Mr.&nbsp;Gallagher is Chairman Emeritus, provided legal services to the Company in 2010 and is expected to provide legal services to the Company in 2011. However, since: (a)&nbsp;the amounts paid
to Gallagher&nbsp;&amp; Kennedy were less than the dollar thresholds set forth in the NYSE rules and the Director Independence Standards; (b)&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Gallagher does not furnish legal services
to the Company; and (c)&nbsp;he has advised the Company that he receives no compensation or benefits from Gallagher&nbsp;&amp; Kennedy as a result of the firm providing legal services to the Company,
the Board determined that Mr.&nbsp;Gallagher was independent. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Parker
is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of US Airways Group,&nbsp;Inc. and US Airways,&nbsp;Inc. (collectively "US Airways"), a commercial airline headquartered in
Phoenix, Arizona, where the Company is also headquartered. In considering the independence of Mr.&nbsp;Parker, the Board considered that directors and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries
purchase air travel and freight services from time to time for business purposes from US Airways. The Board determined that these matters do not impact Mr.&nbsp;Parker's independence because they
are ordinary course, arms-length transactions that are not material to either the Company or US Airways. In addition, the amounts paid to US Airways are less than the dollar thresholds set
forth in the NYSE rules and the Director Independence Standards and are less than one percent of the Company's and US Airways' revenues for fiscal year 2010. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms.&nbsp;Clark-Johnson
is an employee of Arizona State University ("ASU") in her capacity as the Executive Director of the Morrison Institute for Public Policy. Dr.&nbsp;Cortese is
also an employee of ASU in his capacity as Director of the ASU Health Care Delivery and Policy Program and a Foundation Professor in the Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ira A. Fulton School of
Engineering and in the School of Health Management and Policy, W.P. Carey School of Business. ASU is considered a part of the reporting entity for the State of Arizona (the "State") for financial
reporting purposes and, as such, the State is the entity considered in applying the independence tests. In considering the independence of Ms.&nbsp;Clark-Johnson and Dr.&nbsp;Cortese, the Board
considered the fact that transactions between the State and the Company and its affiliates consist of providing electric service, utility-related construction, building and parking leases, and the
payment of various State fees and taxes. The Board determined that these matters do not impact Ms.&nbsp;Clark-Johnson's or Dr.&nbsp;Cortese's independence since amounts paid to or received from
the State are less than the dollar thresholds set forth in the NYSE rules and the Director Independence Standards. In addition, neither of these directors benefits financially, directly or indirectly,
from ASU's business relationships with the Company, most of which consist of receiving electric service at regulated rates. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
respect to all of the directors, the Board considered that many of the directors and/or businesses of which they are officers, directors, shareholders, or employees are located in
Arizona Public Service Company's ("APS") service territory and receive electricity from APS. The Board considered these relationships in determining the directors' independence, but, because the rates
and charges for electricity provided by APS are fixed by the Arizona Corporation Commission ("ACC"), and the directors satisfied the other independence criteria specified in the NYSE rules and the
Director Independence Standards, the Board determined that these relationships did not impact any director's independence. The Board also considered contributions to charitable and
non-profit organizations where a director also serves as a director of such charity or organization. However, since no director is also an executive officer of such charitable or
non-profit organization, the Board determined that these payments did not impact any director's independence.

&#149;reviews and recommends to the Board the Company's dividend actions, including stock dividends and other distributions.
 



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among
other things, the Nuclear and Operating Committee: 




&#149;reviews the results of major inspections and evaluations by external oversight groups, such as the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission ("NRC") and the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations ("INPO");  &#149;reviews and assesses reports from the Palo Verde Oversight Committee (the "PVOC");  &#149;reviews and monitors the power plant operations, energy delivery and customer service functions of the Company; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
PVOC is an independent committee of individuals who have extensive experience and expertise in the design, operation, management, and regulation of nuclear power plants. The purpose
of the PVOC is to provide the Board and APS executive management with an independent assessment of the performance of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station ("Palo Verde"). Performance includes
nuclear safety, plant reliability, plant management, and organizational effectiveness. The PVOC performs assessments of Palo Verde compared to established nuclear industry standards and practices and
corporate requirements, with a particular emphasis on safe operation of the facility and protection of public health, safety, and the environment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the Human Resources Committee's charter, the Human Resources Committee may delegate authority to subcommittees, but did not do so in 2010. 

 
 
  The Board's Leadership Structure        




Lead Director.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kathryn L. Munro serves as the Company's Lead Director and chairs the Corporate Governance Committee. The Lead Director
performs the following functions: 


&#149;serves as a liaison between the Chairman of the Board (the "Chairman") and the independent directors; &#149;advises the Chairman as to an
appropriate schedule of Board meetings, reviews and provides the Chairman with input
regarding agendas for the Board meetings and, as appropriate or as requested, reviews and provides the Chairman with input regarding information sent to the Board;  &#149;presides at all
meetings at which the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors,
which executive sessions are scheduled as part of each Board meeting;  &#149;calls meetings of the independent directors when necessary and appropriate;  &#149;oversees the Board and Board committee self-assessment process;  &#149;is available for consultation and direct communication with the Company's
shareholders and other interested parties; and &#149;performs such other duties as the independent directors may from time to time delegate. 



Chairman and CEO Positions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman is Donald E. Brandt, the Company's CEO. The Board believes that combining the roles of the CEO and
Chairman enhances the Board's ability to communicate clearly and effectively with management, and that an independent Board Chairman would create an additional level of hierarchy that would only
duplicate the activities already being vigorously carried out by its Lead Director. 




 
 
  The Board's Role in Risk Oversight        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimate responsibility for the management of the Company's risks rests with the Company's senior management
team. The Board's oversight of the Company's risk management function is designed to provide assurance that the Company's risk management processes are well adapted to and consistent with the
Company's business and strategy, and are functioning as intended. The Board focuses on fostering a culture of risk awareness and risk-adjusted decision-making and ensuring that an
appropriate "tone at the top" is established. The Board regularly discusses and updates a listing of areas of risk and allocates responsibility for them among the Board committees, which list
includes, among other things, regulatory risk, safety, nuclear operations and compliance, and business continuity. Each committee: 




&#149;receives periodic presentations from management about its assigned risk areas;  &#149;assesses the effectiveness of the risk identification
and mitigation measures being employed; and &#149;discusses their assessments and recommendations with the full Board at least annually. 



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent
with the requirements of the NYSE's corporate governance standards, the Audit Committee periodically reviews the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps
management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Audit Committee also reviews the comprehensiveness of the Board's risk oversight process and plays a coordinating role designed to
ensure that no gaps exist in the coverage by the Board committees of risk areas. In recommending the composition of the Board's committees and the selection of committee Chairs, the Corporate

Governance
Committee takes into account the effective functioning of the risk oversight role of each Board committee, and the risk areas assigned to it. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Executive Risk Committee is comprised of senior level officers of the Company and is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer. Among other responsibilities, this Committee is
responsible for ensuring that the Board receives timely information concerning the Company's material risks and risk management processes. The internal enterprise risk management group reports to the
Vice President, Strategic Initiatives and Risk, who reports to the Chief Financial Officer of APS. The internal risk management group is responsible for (1)&nbsp;implementing a consistent risk
management framework and reporting process across APS, and (2)&nbsp;ensuring that the Executive Risk Committee is informed of those processes and regularly apprised of material existing risks and
the emergence of additional material risks. 

 
 
  Director Qualification; Selection of Nominees for the Board        

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director Qualifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporate Governance Guidelines contain Board membership criteria
that apply to nominees recommended by the Corporate
Governance Committee for a position on the Board. Under these criteria, a director must be a shareholder of the Company. In determining whether an individual should be considered for Board membership,
the Corporate Governance Committee considers the following qualities, among others: integrity; strong business judgment and understanding of corporate governance; knowledge, including regulatory and
political knowledge, and nuclear expertise at the strategic level; understanding of the Company's business environment; the potential contribution of each candidate to the diversity of backgrounds,
experience and competencies which the Board desires to have represented, including large organizational leadership, public company experience and risk management; and technology and science experience
to address the future of smart grids, communication technologies, control systems and renewable energy. The Board periodically reviews and revises these criteria. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection of Nominees for the Board.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporate Governance Committee uses a variety of methods
to identify and evaluate nominees for a director
position. The Corporate Governance Committee regularly assesses the appropriate size of the Board, whether any vacancies on the Board are expected due to retirement or otherwise, and whether the Board
reflects the appropriate balance of knowledge, skills, expertise, and diversity required for the Board as a whole. In the event that vacancies are anticipated, or otherwise arise, the Corporate
Governance Committee may consider various potential candidates. Candidates may come to the attention of the Corporate Governance Committee through current Board members, professional search firms,
shareholders, or other persons. The Corporate Governance Committee evaluates all nominees against the same criteria, regardless of the source of the nomination. Any shareholder nominations proposed
for consideration by the Corporate Governance Committee should include the nominee's name and qualifications for Board membership and should be addressed to: 

Corporate
Secretary
Pinnacle West Capital Corporation
400 North Fifth Street, Mail Station 9068
Phoenix, Arizona 85004 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
shareholder who wishes to submit a nomination for a director to the Board must deliver that nomination to our Corporate Secretary by November&nbsp;18, 2011 and comply with the
information requirements in the Company's Bylaws.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Candidates

nuclear industry and, in May 2010, recommended Dr.&nbsp;Klein for Board membership. Dr.&nbsp;Klein became a director effective June&nbsp;1, 2010. 

 
 
  Director Resignation Due to Substantial Change in Their Primary Business Position        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, upon a substantial change in a director's primary business
position, a director is required to apprise the
Corporate Governance Committee and should offer his or her resignation for consideration to the Corporate Governance Committee. The Corporate Governance Committee will recommend to the Board the
action, if any, to be taken with respect to the tendered resignation. 

 
 
  Communication with the Board        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shareholders and other parties interested in communicating with the Board may do so by writing to the Corporate
Secretary, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, 400 North Fifth Street, Mail Station 9068, P.O.&nbsp;Box&nbsp;53999, Phoenix, Arizona 85072-3999, indicating who should receive the
communication. The Corporate Secretary will transmit communications raising substantial issues to the Lead Director and to the Chair of the Board Committee most closely associated with the matter. The
Corporate Secretary has discretion to exclude communications that are commercial advertisements or other forms of solicitations, individual service or billing complaints and complaints related to
individual employment-related actions. 

 
 
  Company Code of Business Conduct and Ethics; Strategic Framework        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure the highest levels of business ethics, the Board has adopted the Ethics Policy and Standards of
Business Practices, which applies to all employees, officers and directors, and the Code of Ethics for Financial Executives, both of which are described below: 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethics Policy and Standards of Business Practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doing the Right Thing" presents the Ethics
Policy and the Standards of Business Practices of the
Company and its subsidiaries. Employees and directors receive a copy of "Doing the Right Thing" when they join the Company and are provided updates periodically. "Doing the Right Thing" helps ensure
that the employees, officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries act with integrity and avoid any real or perceived violation of the Company's ethics policy, laws, or regulations. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Code of Ethics for Financial Executives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics for Financial
Executives, which is designed to promote honest and
ethical conduct and compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, particularly as related to the maintenance of financial records, the preparation of financial statements, and proper public
disclosure. "Financial Executive" means the
Company's CEO, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Controller, Treasurer, and persons performing similar functions at any of the Company's subsidiaries.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company's directors and
executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of the Company's common stock to file reports of ownership and changes of ownership with the SEC. Based solely on the Company's review of these
reports, the Company believes that its directors, executive officers, and greater than 10% beneficial owners complied with their respective Section&nbsp;16(a) reporting requirements for fiscal year
2010 on a timely basis. 

 
 
  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving all transactions with any Related Party,
which consists of any of our directors, director nominees, executive officers, shareholders owning more than 5% of the Company's common stock and, with respect to each of them, their immediate family
members and certain entities in which they are an officer or a shareholder, partner, member or other participant who, directly or indirectly, has a substantial ownership in or otherwise substantially
controls or shares control of such entity (a "Related Party"). This obligation is set forth in writing in our Statement of Policy Regarding Related Party Transactions (the "Policy"). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
identify Related Party Transactions, as defined in the Policy, each year the Company requires our directors and officers to complete Director and Officer Questionnaires identifying
any transactions with the Company in which a Related Party has an interest. We review Related Party Transactions due to the potential for a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest occurs when an
individual's private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, in any way with our interests. Our Ethics Policy and Standards of Business Practices, "Doing the Right
Thing," require all directors, officers, and employees who may have a potential or apparent conflict of interest to notify the Company's management. In addition, the Policy
specifically provides that any Related Party Transaction must be approved or ratified by the Corporate Governance Committee. A Related Party Transaction is any transaction or a series of similar
transactions in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is or was a participant, where the 

-&nbsp;17&nbsp;-

amount
involved exceeds $120,000 in the aggregate, and in which any Related Party has a direct or indirect material interest, other than: 



&#149;transactions in which rates or charges are fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority (such as APS rates
approved by the ACC);  &#149;transactions in which the rates or charges are determined by competitive bid; or  &#149;the payment of
compensation by the Company to the executive officers, directors, or nominees for directors.

  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION    

 
    Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&amp;A")        




 Overview of 2010 Company Performance  




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year was a successful year for our Company despite challenging economic conditions. Our significant accomplishments and
improvements in 2010 include: 




&#149;the Company's total shareholder return ("TSR") in 2010 was 20% compared with 4% for the S&amp;P&nbsp;1500 Super Composite
Electrics Index (the "S&amp;P&nbsp;1500");  &#149;the Company's common share price increased more than 13%, compared to a 0.5% decrease in the S&amp;P&nbsp;1500; &#149;Palo Verde achieved a capacity factor of 90.5% and the fossil power plants achieved a commercial availability factor of
92.2%;  &#149;we achieved our safest year on record, placing us in the first quartile of our industry;  &#149;we continued to
effectively implement our wind-down strategy for the Company's non-regulated
businesses;  &#149;APS signed contracts for the first 70 megawatts of utility-owned solar power under the AZ Sun program through which APS
plans to invest up to $500&nbsp;million for the construction of 100 MW of multiple solar photovoltaic power plants across Arizona; and  &#149;APS ranked fifth among all 59 large segment
utilities in J.D. Power and Associates 2010 Residential Customer Satisfaction
Study. 





 Compensation Objectives  




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental objectives of the Company's executive compensation strategy are: 




&#149;Alignment with Shareholder Interests. A significant portion of compensation should be tied to
the Company's stock performance through performance-based or other stock incentives so that executives' interests are tied to the success of the Company and aligned with those of our shareholders. &#149;Business Performance Accountability. Compensation should be tied to the Company's performance
in several key areas, including furthering our Strategic Framework, so that executives are focused on specific strategic and operating objectives and are held accountable through their compensation
for the performance of the Company.  &#149;Individual Performance Accountability. Compensation should be tied to an individual's
performance so that individual contributions to the Company's performance are rewarded.  &#149;Retention. Compensation should be designed to promote key employee retention.
&#149;Competitiveness. The compensation program should be designed to attract and reward key
leaders critical to the Company's success by providing total compensation levels and programs that are competitive and fair. 



 Setting Executive Compensation  




 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Resources Committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Resources Committee (for purposes of this CD&amp;A, the
"Committee") monitors executive officer compensation
throughout the year and undertakes a thorough analysis of our executive officer compensation each Fall. This review includes consideration of competitive positions relative to specified labor markets,
the mix of elements of compensation, the degree and type of performance focus, and a consideration of individual officer evaluations. From December through February, the Committee then makes
adjustments to executive officer compensation, including salary and cash and non-cash incentives. 

-&nbsp;19&nbsp;-




 

Table of Contents


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Role of Executive Officers in Determining Executive Compensation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee makes all
compensation decisions relating to our CEO's compensation,
makes awards under the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2007 Plan"), and determines the awards under the 2010 Incentive Plans (as defined on page&nbsp;27 of this proxy statement). The
Committee recommends other executive officer compensation decisions, which are approved by the Board. Management works with the Committee in establishing the agenda for Committee meetings and in
preparing meeting information. Management conducts evaluations and provides information on the performance of the executive officers for the Committee's consideration and provides such other
information as the Committee may request. Management also assists the Committee in recommending salary levels, annual incentive plan structure and design, including corporate and business unit
performance targets or other goals, long-term incentive plan structure and design, including award levels, and the type, structure, and amount of other awards. The executive officers are
available to the Committee's compensation consultant to provide information as requested by the consultant. At the request of the Chair of the Committee, the CEO or other officers may attend and
participate in portions of the Committee's meetings. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Role of Compensation Consultants.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee's charter gives the Committee the sole authority
to retain and terminate any consulting firm used by
the Committee in evaluating non-employee director and officer compensation. The Committee engaged Frederick W. Cook&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Co. to assist the Committee in its evaluation of 2010
compensation for our executive officers (the "Consultant"). The Committee instructed the Consultant to prepare a competitive analysis of the compensation of the executive officers of the Company and
of APS, and to make recommendations for changes to the existing compensation program. The Consultant does not provide any other services to the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultant's Report and Comparator Group.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consultant reviewed our executive compensation
practices against the market and considered the extent to which these practices support our executive compensation strategy. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
part of this study, the Consultant performed competitive pay comparisons for our executive officers based on: 



&#149;compensation information as disclosed in 2009 SEC filings for the comparator group described below; &#149;general industry data based on
surveys published by Hewitt Associates,&nbsp;Inc. (averaging data for companies in the
$2.5&nbsp;&#150; $5&nbsp;billion revenue bracket and the $5&nbsp;&#150; $10&nbsp;billion revenue bracket) and Towers, Perrin, Forster&nbsp;&amp; Crosby,&nbsp;Inc. ("Towers
Perrin") (averaging data for companies in the $3&nbsp;&#150; $6&nbsp;billion revenue bracket and the $6&nbsp;&#150; $10&nbsp;billion revenue bracket); and &#149;industry-specific survey data
from the Towers Perrin Energy Services Industry Survey (reflecting the average between
companies in the $3&nbsp;&#150; $6&nbsp;billion revenue bracket and companies with revenues greater than $6&nbsp;billion). 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
these sources, the Consultant developed a competitive consensus, with industry-specific data assigned a two-thirds weighting and general industry data assigned a
one-third weighting. For the Named Executive Officers with position matches in all three peer sets (Messrs.&nbsp;Brandt, Hatfield, Falck and Robinson), the data reflects
one-third proxy statement data, one-third Energy Services Industry Survey, and one-third general industry surveys. For the Named Executive Officers without a
matching general industry survey position (Mr.&nbsp;Edington and Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler), the data reflects one-half proxy statement data and one-half Energy Services Industry
Survey. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
part of the executive compensation review for 2010, the Committee reviewed the comparator group for its continued appropriateness with the assistance of the Consultant. As a result
of such 

-&nbsp;20&nbsp;-




 

Table of Contents



review,
the Committee approved the continuing use of the comparator group used in setting 2009 executive compensation with the exception of Puget Energy,&nbsp;Inc., which was removed from the
comparator group when it ceased to be a publicly-traded company. The comparator group is broadly similar to the Company with respect to industry, complexity, business lines and size, and positions the
Company closer to the median with respect to revenues, assets, market cap, and total megawatts owned
or managed. The 2010 comparator group consists of the following companies (the "Comparator Group"):

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consultant considered that APS' reported revenues do not reflect the actual size and complexity of its operations since APS is a minority
owner in both Palo Verde and the Four Corners Power Plant but APS manages the facilities on behalf of all the owners. This issue was addressed by adjusting APS revenues to take revenues attributable
to managed assets into account. As a result, APS adjusted revenues approximate the median of the Comparator Group. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
providing information to the Committee with respect to setting 2010 compensation, the Consultant reviewed the total compensation of the Named Executive Officers and the individual
elements of that compensation, including the type and balance of annual incentives and long-term incentives, and evaluated the competitiveness of the total compensation and individual
elements of compensation of each such officer based on the survey data discussed above. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
its analysis, presented in October 2009 and based upon data for 2008 as disclosed in proxy statements, the Consultant looked at actual compensation paid to the Named Executive
Officers as compared to the 25th, 50th&nbsp;and 75th&nbsp;percentile (data was treated at the 25th, 50th&nbsp;or the
75th&nbsp;percentile if

1&nbsp;Actual annual incentive earned for performance in 2008. Mr.&nbsp;Falck joined the Company
in July 2009 and did not participate in the 2008 annual incentive plan. 
2&nbsp;Messrs.&nbsp;Edington's and Falck's amounts include the annualized value of special deferred compensation awards of $1,000,000 and $50,000 respectively.
Mr.&nbsp;Falck's amount includes performance shares and RSUs that were part of his hiring package. In determining the amount of the initial equity grant to Mr.&nbsp;Falck, the Committee took into
consideration equity grants from his prior employer that Mr.&nbsp;Falck forfeited when he became an employee of the Company. 
3&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Edington's base salary was increased in June 2008 to $800,000. This increase was based on the significant performance improvements at Palo Verde and existing
market conditions for individuals with his experience in the nuclear industry. The participant owners of Palo Verde share Mr.&nbsp;Edington's compensation expense. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application of the Committee's Judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analysis in the Consultant's report and its
recommendations regarding the competitiveness and structure
of compensation are factors that the Committee takes into account in its evaluation of compensation for the Named Executive Officers. In addition, the Committee considers how the Consultant's
recommendations regarding particular elements of compensation may differ from management's recommendations. The Committee also focuses on the individual executives and their individual
responsibilities, skills, expertise, value added through
performance, internal equity, and other external factors, and applies these views in conjunction with the information provided by the Consultant. The performance of each officer is formally reviewed
each year by management and shared with the Committee. Individual performance evaluations consider individual goals and include a discussion of the officer's strengths and overall value to the
Company. CEO performance is separately reviewed by the Committee. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Committee also considers written commitments in determining or recommending executive pay. For example, under the offer letters pursuant to which Messrs.&nbsp;Edington, Hatfield,
and Falck were hired, each is entitled to a fixed starting salary and other specified benefits that are described in more detail below under "Narrative Disclosure" on page&nbsp;46 of this proxy
statement. The Committee approved the terms of these offer letters after considering the entire compensation package in the context of the desirability of hiring these officers. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
making any decision regarding an executive's compensation, the Committee considers the officer's total compensation, but with an increased emphasis on performance-based or other
long-term

While compensation competitiveness is a priority, Company, business unit, and individual officer performance are the primary factors determining the level of total direct compensation
for the Named Executive Officers. While the Committee considers internal pay equity in making compensation decisions, we do not have a policy requiring any set levels of internal pay differentiation.
Finally, the Committee considers other factors that it considers relevant, such as the financial condition of the Company and APS. The Company does not have a pre-established policy or
target for allocation between cash and non-cash compensation or between short-term and long-term incentive compensation. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation Design&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance-Based Compensation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company believes that a significant portion of each Named
Executive Officer's total compensation opportunity
should be performance-based, reflecting both upside potential and downside risk. The illustrations that follow show the allocation of the Named Executive Officers' total compensation between
nonperformance-based (base salary and hiring and retention payments) and performance-based (annual and other cash incentive, performance shares, and restricted stock units ("RSUs")) components.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk-Taking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compensation program is designed to reward performance but not encourage
unacceptable risk-taking. The
Committee evaluates the potential for unacceptable risk-taking in compensation design on an ongoing basis. We believe that the design of our executive compensation

program
does not unduly incentivize our executives to take actions that may conflict with our risk-based decision-making. Material risk in our compensation design is mitigated in several
ways: 



&#149;base salaries are intended to constitute a sufficient component of total compensation to discourage inappropriate
risk-taking;  &#149;earnings goals and award opportunities in our annual cash incentive programs are at levels intended to be attainable
without the need to take inappropriate risks;  &#149;approximately 50% of our long-term incentives are time-based RSUs that vest over a
multi-year period and the other 50% are in the form of performance shares that are earned at the end of a three-year period, both of which provide upside potential and downside
risk. Moreover, the use of RSUs in our long-term incentive program mitigates the likelihood of risk-taking because RSUs, as opposed to stock options, for example, retain some
value even in a depressed market;  &#149;payouts are capped under the annual and long-term incentive plans;  &#149;more than one
performance metric is used in our long-term performance share awards and the award opportunities
under our annual incentive program are based on multiple considerations, thereby minimizing the ability of the executive to manipulate results;  &#149;the stock components inherent in our
long-term incentive program, combined with our stock ownership guidelines
and retention requirements, align the interests of our executives with a goal of long-term appreciation of shareholder value;  &#149;compensation is generally targeted to the median of the
competitive consensus and compensation elements used by comparator
companies are considered in compensation design, thereby avoiding unusually high pay opportunities relative to Company peers;  &#149;our program is consistent throughout the Company so that no
one area or group is incentivized in a manner that would
encourage risk-taking; and  &#149;although the Company may pay hiring bonuses and agree to certain severance benefits for limited periods as part of a
hiring package for senior executives, the Company's executives generally do not have guaranteed bonuses or high-value severance packages on terminations not involving a
change-in-control. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Compensation Components

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company's 2010 executive compensation program consists of the following components: 



  


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, the Company provides pension programs, a deferred compensation program, change-in-control arrangements and limited perquisites.

Alternate 2010 Compensation Table    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Alternate 2010 Compensation Table shows the 2010 compensation paid to the Named
Executive Officers as considered by the Committee in setting compensation and differs from the Summary Compensation Table shown on page&nbsp;41 of this proxy statement. The differences are that this
table: (i)&nbsp;excludes the Bonus column since the only amount paid in 2010 that would fall into this column was the second-year hiring incentive to Mr.&nbsp;Falck that was paid
pursuant to his 2009 hiring package; (ii)&nbsp;includes the full grant date fair value of the Supplemental RSUs that were granted to the Named Executive Officers in 2011 because the grants were
given in recognition of outstanding performance in 2010 (see the discussion of the Supplemental RSUs on page&nbsp;35 of this proxy statement); (iii)&nbsp;excludes the "Change in Pension Value" and
"All Other Compensation" columns as the Committee did not consider these post-retirement elections in setting salary, annual cash incentives and equity awards for the Named Executive
Officers for 2010; and (iv)&nbsp;excludes information for Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler due to his retirement in September 2010:

Base Salary    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee reviews competitive salary information and individual salaries for executive officers on an annual
basis. The Named Executive Officers do not have a contractual right to receive a fixed base salary, except that a starting annual base salary is often specified when an officer is hired. In
considering individual salaries, the Committee reviews the scope of job responsibilities, internal equity, individual contributions, business performance, retention concerns, and current compensation
compared to market practices. In setting base salaries, the Committee also considers that base salary is used as the basis for calculating annual incentive awards and in calculating payments that may
be made on a change-in-control event as described under "Change-in-Control Agreements" on page&nbsp;38 of this proxy statement. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
2009, Messrs.&nbsp;Brandt, Hatfield and Robinson were at the 25th&nbsp;percentile for base salary compared to the Comparator Group. The Committee decided to move
these individuals closer to the median over a two to three year period. In December 2009, the Committee made the following

Annual Incentives    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have used incentive programs for all our employees for a number of years. The performance criteria that underlie
the annual incentive programs generally focus on the Strategic Framework and the following objectives (the "General Performance Objectives"): 



&#149;shareholder value creation;  &#149;customer service;  &#149;financial strength;
&#149;operating performance;  &#149;safety; and  &#149;an assessment of
individual performance. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
use the annual incentive programs to further the Strategic Framework and achieve the General Performance Objectives. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
order to promote specific goals for 2010, the Committee approved the Pinnacle West 2010 Annual Incentive Award Plan (the "CEO Incentive Plan") in December 2009. The plan covered
Mr.&nbsp;Brandt and provided him with an incentive opportunity of up to 150% of his base salary. Also in December 2009, acting on the recommendation of the Committee, the Board approved the APS 2010
Annual Incentive Award Plan (the "APS Incentive Plan"), which covered Messrs.&nbsp;Hatfield, Falck, Robinson and Wheeler, and the 2010 APS Palo Verde Employee Incentive Plan (the "Palo Verde
Incentive Plan"), which covered Mr.&nbsp;Edington. The APS Incentive Plan and the Palo Verde Incentive Plan are collectively referred to as the "APS Incentive Plans," and the APS Incentive Plans and
the CEO Incentive Plan are collectively referred to as the "2010 Incentive Plans." The APS Incentive Plans provided Mr.&nbsp;Robinson an incentive opportunity of up to 150% of his base pay and
provided Messrs.&nbsp;Edington, Falck, Hatfield and Wheeler with an incentive opportunity of up to 100% of their base salaries. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
award opportunity under the CEO Incentive Plan for Mr.&nbsp;Brandt (based on a percentage of base pay) was tied to Pinnacle West earnings and the award opportunity under the APS
Incentive Plan for Mr.&nbsp;Robinson was tied to APS earnings. In each case, the Committee could modify the award based on the General Performance Objectives or other factors. 

-&nbsp;27&nbsp;-




 

Table of Contents

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
award opportunity under the APS Incentive Plans (based on a percentage of base pay) for Messrs.&nbsp;Edington, Falck, Hatfield and Wheeler was as follows: 



  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the 2010 Incentive Plans, participants were not eligible for an incentive payment unless a minimum earnings level was met. In designing the 2010 Incentive Plans, the Committee
attempted to set the target earnings based on a reasonable range of expectations for the year, while taking into account prior year performance and current economic conditions. Individual business
unit goals that could be directly correlated to earnings were set at levels that, if achieved at target, would contribute to earnings being achieved at target. However, some of the metrics, like
safety and customer satisfaction, are not directly correlated to earnings, and are instead set based on prior year performance and a reasonable range of expectations of performance of comparable
companies in our industry. Notwithstanding the achievement of earnings or business unit targets, the amount of incentive payments under the 2010 Incentive Plans remained in the sole discretion of the
Committee, which allows the Committee to consider the General Performance Objectives and other factors. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
business unit performance measures are tied to the components of our Strategic Framework. The following table details the performance measures under the 2010 Incentive Plans, as
correlated to the Strategic Framework, and compares the targets to actual results:

2Palo Verde business unit performance was measured in terms of the maximum potential, consistent with past
practices. All other business units' performances were measured in terms of a target potential. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Palo Verde Incentive Plan, Mr.&nbsp;Edington is not eligible for an incentive payout under the APS earnings portion of the plan

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The award opportunity for Mr.&nbsp;Brandt considered the achievement of the 2010 Pinnacle West earnings targets and the General Performance Objectives.
Mr.&nbsp;Brandt had an award opportunity of up to 50% of his base salary if the threshold earnings level was met, up to 100% of his base salary if the target earnings level was met, and up to 150%
of his base salary if the maximum earnings level was met. Pinnacle West's 2010 earnings, as defined, were $330&nbsp;million, or 165% of the target earnings level. The award opportunity for
Mr.&nbsp;Robinson under the APS Incentive Plan considered the achievement of the 2010 APS earnings targets and the General Performance Objectives. Mr.&nbsp;Robinson had an award opportunity of up
to 37.5% of his base salary if the threshold earnings level was met, up to 75% of his base salary if the target earnings level was met, and up to 150% of his base salary if the maximum earnings level
was met. APS' 2010 earnings, as defined, were $336&nbsp;million, or 153% of the target earnings level. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to considering Pinnacle West earnings (in the case of Mr.&nbsp;Brandt) and APS earnings (in the case of Mr.&nbsp;Robinson), the Committee considered the General
Performance Objectives in determining the incentive awards for Mr.&nbsp;Brandt and Mr.&nbsp;Robinson. With respect to Mr.&nbsp;Brandt, the Committee considered significant accomplishments under
each of the General Performance Objectives, including the significant increase in TSR and stock price and the outstanding performance of the business units. As a result of these factors, the Committee
awarded Mr.&nbsp;Brandt $1,440,000, the maximum award. With respect to Mr.&nbsp;Robinson, the Committee considered the fact that, although the business unit performance measures results were
significantly above target performance levels, the Customer Service, Delivery and Regulatory performance measures for safety and operational excellence, the Fossil
performance measures for operational excellence, and the Shared Services performance measures for safety and operational excellence, were not all achieved at the maximum level. As a result of these
factors, the Committee awarded Mr.&nbsp;Robinson $712,388 under the APS Incentive Plan (compared to a maximum award potential of $825,000). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messrs.&nbsp;Hatfield,
Edington, Falck and Wheeler were each eligible for a maximum incentive award equal to 100% of his base salary. Fifty percent of the award opportunity was based
on the achievement of the 2010 APS earnings targets and 50% of the award opportunity was based on the achievement of specific business unit metrics. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the APS Incentive Plans, Messrs.&nbsp;Hatfield, Falck and Wheeler each had an award opportunity of 25% of his base salary if the target earnings level was met and up to 50% of
his base salary if the maximum earnings level was met. Under the Palo Verde Plan, Mr.&nbsp;Edington had an award opportunity of 25% of his base salary if the target earnings level was met and up to
50% of his base salary if the maximum earnings level was met. APS' 2010 earnings were $336&nbsp;million, which exceeded the target level of $317&nbsp;million. After determining that APS had
exceeded the minimum earnings level, the Committee considered for Messrs.&nbsp;Hatfield and Falck the achievement of the Shared Services business unit performance measures, for Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler
the Customer Service, Delivery and Regulatory performance measures, and for Mr.&nbsp;Edington the achievement of Palo Verde business unit performance measures. In light of APS' earnings and the
173.5% of target achievement of cumulative targets in the Shared Services business unit, the Committee determined to award Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield $382,005, compared to a maximum award potential of
$468,000, and Mr.&nbsp;Falck $374,659, compared to a maximum award potential of $459,000. In light of APS' earnings and the 192.3% of target achievement of cumulative targets in the Customer
Service, Delivery and Regulatory business unit, the Committee determined to award Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler $393,642 compared to a maximum award potential of $456,000. In light of APS' earnings and the 90.6%
maximum achievement of cumulative targets in the Palo Verde business unit, the Committee determined to award Mr.&nbsp;Edington $668,400, compared to a maximum award potential of $800,000.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Committee considered the accomplishments set forth under "Overview of 2010 Company Performance" in considering incentive payouts, but did not assign a specific weighting to any one
factor. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
December 2009, the Board approved an award opportunity for Mr.&nbsp;Edington of up to $125,000 for the achievement of various Palo Verde operational targets during 2010. We
describe this award in more detail under "Narrative Disclosure" on page&nbsp;46 of this proxy statement. In January 2011, Mr.&nbsp;Brandt approved an award amount of $125,000 under this
opportunity for Mr.&nbsp;Edington. In December 2010, the Board approved the 2011 Palo Verde Specific Compensation Opportunity, which gives Mr.&nbsp;Edington the opportunity to receive up to
$125,000 upon the achievement of metrics tied to 2011 performance. The specifics of this 2011 incentive are not necessary to an understanding of Mr.&nbsp;Edington's 2010 compensation so they will be
described in our 2012 proxy statement. 

Long-Term Incentives  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-term incentives generally consist of 50% performance shares and 50% RSUs. The 2010 grants to the
Named Executive Officers were as follows:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use performance shares because we believe they effectively tie long-term compensation to shareholder value, and we use RSUs to
allow us to balance the goals of maximizing performance and promoting officer retention. Time-based RSUs also assist in mitigating risk incentives. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
determine the amount of performance share and RSU awards, the Committee first establishes a target compensation value for each officer that it wants to deliver through
long-term equity awards opportunities. The Committee considers various factors, including the retention value of
the total compensation package, the long-term equity component in light of the competitive environment, and individual performance. The Committee also considers target value in light of
the Company's budget and performance. Once the target value is established, the Committee determines the number of shares subject to the awards by reference to the then-current market
value of the Company's common stock. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance Shares.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use performance shares to promote long-term performance. We granted
performance shares to our Named Executive
Officers in January 2010 for a three-year performance period (the "2010 Performance Shares").

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
following graph illustrates how the 2010 Performance Shares work: 



  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Committee grants each award recipient a specified number of performance shares, which is considered the "Base Grant." The maximum award opportunity is 200% of the Base Grant (100%
under the TSR metric and 100% under the performance metrics). The 2010 Performance Shares have two distinct performance elements: 

 50% of the Base Grant

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance shares granted in 2009 tied this 50% of the Base Grant to earnings per share compounded annual growth rate as compared to the
earnings per share compounded annual growth rate of the companies in the Index. In January 2010, the Committee determined that TSR is a more appropriate metric for shareholder value than earnings per
share. TSR is the measure of a company's stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid during the performance period. We believe using TSR strengthens the link between officer performance and
shareholder return. Additionally, TSR is the most prevalent long-term incentive metric used among the Comparator Group. We anticipate that the common stock payout, if any, related to this
performance element will be made on or about January&nbsp;25, 2013.

Table of Contents

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's "Average Performance" with respect to the performance metrics will be the average of the Company's percentile ranking for each of
the following performance metrics during each of the three years of the performance period: 



&#149;the J.D. Power Residential Survey percentile ranking of the Company relative to other participating companies; &#149;the Edison Electric
Institute quartile ranking (or percentile ranking, if available) associated with the Company's
customer reliability results relative to other participating companies;  &#149;the Company's ranking for a customer-to-employee improvement ratio, based on data provided by SNL
("SNL"), an independent third party data system relative to other companies reported in the SNL data;  &#149;the Company's percentile ranking based on the OSHA rate (All Incident Injury Rate)
relative to other companies reported in
the EEI data;  &#149;the Company's percentile ranking based on nuclear generation capacity factors relative to other companies reported in the
SNL data; and  &#149;the Company's percentile ranking based on coal generation capacity factors relative to other companies reported in the SNL
data. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These
metrics attempt to add factors that will more effectively motivate performance while still achieving desired goals of the Company. The metrics selected encompass performance
inclusive of all departments and are direct indicators of key business performance success. The metrics can be readily benchmarked and will provide a clear barometer of top-tier
performance excellence. We believe a focus on these performance metrics over a three-year period will align long-term compensation with key operational goals, thereby enhancing
overall Company performance. We anticipate that the common stock payout, if any, related to this performance element will be made on or about November&nbsp;30, 2013. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
recipient must also remain employed with the Company throughout the performance period, unless the recipient retires. In the case of the recipient's retirement, the employee is
deemed to have been employed through the end of the performance period. A participant who receives an award of performance shares is also entitled to additional shares of common stock equal to the
amount of dividends that the participant would have received had the participant directly owned the shares from the date of grant to the date of payment, plus interest on such dividends at the rate of
5% per annum, compounded quarterly, divided by the fair market value of one share of stock on the date of the stock payout. This common stock is paid out when the related common stock payout is made.
The 2010 Performance Shares are not included in the calculating of pension benefits. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
include the 2010 Performance Shares in the Summary Compensation Table on page&nbsp;41 of this proxy statement in the column under "Stock Awards" and in the 2010 Grants of
Plan-Based Awards table on page&nbsp;44 of this proxy statement. They are also included in the Alternate 2010 Compensation Table on page&nbsp;26 of this proxy statement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RSUs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We granted RSUs to our Named Executive Officers in January 2010. RSUs are incentive awards
that vest over a number of years if the award
recipient remains employed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries. Each RSU represents the fair market value of one share of our common stock on the applicable vesting date. The following graph
illustrates how the 2010 RSUs work: 



  


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
2010 RSUs: 



&#149;fully vest before the end of the regular vesting period if the participant retires. Mr.&nbsp;Robinson is treated as
fully-vested by virtue of this provision since he currently qualifies for early retirement and Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler is fully-vested due to his retirement in September 2010. Unvested RSUs are forfeited
if the participant's employment is terminated for any other reason;  &#149;are payable in stock or 50% cash and 50% stock, as the RSUs vest, at the election of the participant made shortly
after
the date of the initial grant, in an amount equal to the number of RSUs vesting multiplied by the closing price of a share of our common stock on the vesting date. In the case of a participant's
retirement before the end of the vesting period, the RSUs are payable on the dates and in the percentages specified in the vesting schedule even though fully-vested prior to those dates; &#149;accrue dividend rights on the vested RSUs, equal to the amount of dividends that the participant would have received had
the participant directly owned stock equal to the number of vested RSUs from the date of grant to the date of payment, plus interest at the rate of 5% per annum, compounded quarterly, with such amount
paid either in stock or 50% stock and 50% cash. To determine the number of shares of stock issued, the amount of dividends and interest allocated to the stock will be divided by the fair market value
of one share of stock on the date of the stock payout; and  &#149;are not included in the calculation of pension benefits. 


The
2010 RSUs are included in the Summary Compensation Table on page&nbsp;41 of this proxy statement in the column under "Stock Awards" and in the 2010 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table
on page&nbsp;44 of this proxy statement. They are also included in the Alternate 2010 Compensation Table on page&nbsp;26 of this proxy statement. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant of Supplemental RSUs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2011, the Committee granted to the Company's officers
awards of a special class of RSUs that are payable
solely in shares of common stock upon the recipient's retirement or other separation of employment. The Named Executive Officers received the following awards of these Supplemental RSUs:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee believes that the Company's management team contributed
meaningfully to these superior results for shareholders. In addition to the
financial returns, the Committee took into account the Company's achievements set forth under "Overview of 2010 Company Performance" on page&nbsp;19 of this proxy statement, a number of which it
believes should set the foundation for continued improvement in the Company's operations and financial profile. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supplemental RSUs will assist the Company to retain management.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee believes that the grants will encourage
the retention of the executive team as well as other officers. The Company's officer group has experienced substantial change in the last three years through a combination of retirements, promotions
and external hires. A number of officers have substantial prior experience in the utility industry. The Committee understands that the market for executive talent in this industry is increasingly
competitive, and that as a result the executive team is regularly exposed to a variety of other career opportunities. Accordingly, retention of experienced and qualified management will continue to be
a priority for the Company. Equity grants such as the Supplemental RSUs are a commonly-used market technique for retention purposes. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally,
the Committee took into account that previous performance share grants awarded to a number of officers resulted in zero payouts in 2009 and 2010, due to the effect of
substantial impairment charges necessitated by the Company's exit from real estate development and other unregulated businesses which began in 2009. This strategy has been successfully implemented to
date through the liquidation of substantially all real estate operating assets and the sale of the Company's district cooling business. The liquidations and divestitures have generated more than
$180&nbsp;million of net cash proceeds and have de-risked the Company's financial profile, contributed to its improved liquidity and improved the Company's position in the credit
markets. However, due to the resulting negative effect of the impairment charges on the previous performance share grants, the retention purpose that would have been served by the delivery of the
original target value of these long-term incentives was not achieved. The Committee believes that the grants of Supplemental RSUs provide a retention incentive directly connected to the
strong shareholder value created in the period when the previously-granted performance shares were ineffective to do so.

grants should encourage the continued availability of key management to the Company and the consistent execution of business plans over the long-range horizon that
typically characterizes the utility business. The Committee noted that since the Supplemental RSUs will result in the issuance of common stock, they will effectively increase management's personal
stake in Pinnacle West and thereby further align management's interests with shareholder interests. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description of the Supplemental RSUs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the structure of the Supplemental RSUs and the size of the grants
awarded, the Committee consulted with its compensation consultant with respect to market practices. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Supplemental RSUs, which are granted under the 2007 Plan: 





&#149;will each represent the right to receive one share of Pinnacle West common stock;  &#149;will vest in increments on the second, third and
fourth anniversary dates of the grant date as follows, provided that the
recipient remains employed by Pinnacle West or its subsidiaries on each such date: 



 






 










Date 
&nbsp;
Percentage of Each Grant
That Will Vest


&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;


February 2013
&nbsp;
50%


February 2014
&nbsp;
25%


February 2015
&nbsp;
25%



 
 



&#149;will result in the issuance of shares of common stock to the recipient upon the recipient's retirement, death, disability
or separation of employment from the Company;  &#149;will accrue notional dividends equal to the amount of dividends that a recipient would have received if the recipient had
directly owned one share of Pinnacle West common stock for each Supplemental RSU held by the recipient from the grant date to each dividend payment date. The recipient will be credited with additional
Supplemental RSUs on each dividend payment date equal to the amount of such dividends paid on such date divided by the fair market value of one share of common stock on such date. Such additional
Supplemental RSUs will proportionally vest on the same remaining vesting schedule that applies to the original Supplemental RSUs and will result in the issuance of shares of common stock as provided
above;  &#149;will be forfeited, to the extent that they have not vested, at any time when the recipient's employment is terminated; and &#149;will be excluded for purposes of the calculation of pension benefits. 




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
the Supplemental RSUs were granted in 2011, they are not included in the Summary Compensation Table on page&nbsp;41 of this proxy statement nor in the 2010 Grants of
Plan-Based Awards table on page&nbsp;44 of this proxy statement. They are included in the Alternate 2010 Compensation Table on page&nbsp;26 of this proxy statement.

Benefits    


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pension Programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Named Executive Officers participate in the Pinnacle West Retirement Plan
("Retirement Plan") and the Supplemental Excess
Benefit Retirement Plan (the "Supplemental Plan"). We describe these plans in more detail under "Discussion of Pension Benefits" beginning on page&nbsp;52 of this proxy statement. The Company
believes that the pension programs are important recruitment and retention tools. In October 2010, the Committee reviewed the terms of the Supplemental Plan and decided to reduce the salary credits to
a range of 8% to 18% as compared to the previous range of 12% to 28%, generally eliminate the retroactive feature and the 25-year service limit, and remove the joint and survivor subsidy.
These changes will be in effect for executive officers elected after January&nbsp;1, 2011. The Committee changed the Supplemental Plan in order to better align it with existing market practices but
still provide a competitive benefit. These changes are discussed in more detail under "Discussion of Pension Benefits". See "Narrative Disclosure" on page 46 for a discussion of the Wheeler Retirement
Agreement. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred Compensation Programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company offers to its executive officers the ability, if the
officer so chooses, to participate in a deferred
compensation program. We describe our deferred compensation program in more detail under "Discussion of Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" beginning on page&nbsp;55 of this proxy statement. We
offer our deferred compensation program because the Committee believes that it is standard market practice to permit officers to defer all, or some portion, of their cash compensation. However, we
generally consider the value in the deferred compensation plan to be the participant's own money and do not give this amount significant weight in making compensation decisions. Obligations under the
deferred compensation program are unfunded and unsecured. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change-in-Control Agreements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains change-in-control arrangements
("Change-in-Control Agreements") for our officers, including the Named Executive Officers. Similar to our deferred compensation programs,
Change-in-Control Agreements do not have a significant impact on compensation design. However, in setting annual incentives, we do consider that the
change-in-control payment, if triggered, would be based on the average of these amounts for the prior four years. We discuss our Change-in-Control
Agreements under "Change-in-Control Agreements" on page&nbsp;61 of this proxy statement. Our Change-in-Control Agreements are customary "double
trigger" agreements that provide severance benefits if, during a specified period following a change-in-control, the Company terminates an employee without "cause" or the
employee terminates employment "for good reason." We believe that the possibility of strategic transactions or unsolicited offers creates job uncertainty for executives, and that the
Change-in-Control Agreements are effective tools to provide incentives for executives to stay with the Company in light of these uncertainties. In addition, we believe that if
the agreements are appropriately structured they do not deter takeovers or disadvantage shareholders. The Company's agreements are terminable on six months prior notice, prior to a
change-in-control. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
May 2009, in connection with a review of its executive compensation practices, the Company determined that, on a going forward basis, it would no longer provide excise tax
gross-up payments in new and materially amended Change-in-Control Agreements with its Named Executive Officers. In unusual circumstances where the Company believes
that accommodations have to be made to recruit a new executive to the Company, limited reimbursement for taxes payable on change-of-control payments may be included in
executives' contracts, but even in those circumstances, the excise tax gross-ups will be limited to payments triggered by both a change-in-control and termination
of employment and will be subject to a three-year sunset provision.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perquisites.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had a long-standing policy of providing only limited perquisites to our
executive officers. We describe our
perquisites paid to each of the Named Executive Officers in footnote&nbsp;4 to the Summary Compensation Table on page&nbsp;41 of this proxy statement. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxation and Accounting Considerations Regarding Executive Compensation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publicly-traded
corporations generally are not permitted to deduct, for federal income tax purposes, annual compensation in excess of $1&nbsp;million paid to any of certain top
executives, except to the extent the compensation qualifies as "performance-based" under rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code. The Company does not use the deduction as a justification for
awarding compensation below $1&nbsp;million. To the extent the awards do exceed $1&nbsp;million, the Company believes that it is in the shareholders' best interests to not only consider what
components qualify for the deduction, but also preserve flexibility in designing a compensation program. For example, the RSUs described above do not qualify as performance-based compensation under
the applicable tax provisions. The Committee and the Board may weigh the tax and accounting consequences of the total compensation program and the individual components of compensation when setting
total compensation and determining the individual elements of an officer's compensation package. However, the Committee and the Board do not routinely apply the tax-deductibility rules to
limit what they determine otherwise to be necessary and appropriate compensation awards. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock Ownership Guidelines

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that linking a significant portion of an officer's current and potential future net worth to the Company's success, as reflected in our stock price, helps to ensure that
officers have a stake similar to that of our shareholders. Stock ownership guidelines also encourage the long-term management of the Company for the benefit of the shareholders. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company's Stock Ownership Guidelines (the "Guidelines") are based on the officer's position and his or her base salary. The ownership requirements are shown in the table below in
respect of the indicated officer position: 










Officer



 
&nbsp;
Multiple of Base Salary



 



Chief Executive Officer
&nbsp;

3 times Base Salary


APS President and all Executive and Senior Vice&nbsp;Presidents
&nbsp;
2 times Base Salary


All Other Vice Presidents and Officers
&nbsp;
1 times Base Salary





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each officer is expected to meet his or her ownership requirement within five years following the later of January 2010 or such officer's
election (the "Phase-in Period"). In the event of (i)&nbsp;a promotion that would cause the officer to move into a higher multiple level or (ii)&nbsp;a base salary increase of more
than 20% over the officer's previous base salary, an officer will have an additional three years to meet his or her applicable ownership requirement. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
types of ownership arrangements counted toward the Guidelines are: common stock, whether held individually or jointly or in trust with or for the benefit of an immediate family
member; shares issued upon the vesting of RSUs or the payout of performance shares; and unvested RSUs to the extent they will result in the issuance of common stock to the officer.

Table of Contents

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers
may not sell, pledge, margin, hedge, or otherwise grant an economic interest in ("Dispose") any shares of Company stock received by them pursuant to any of the Company's
compensation or benefit programs (net of shares sold or surrendered to meet tax withholding or exercise requirements) until his or her ownership requirement has been met. Thereafter, the officer may
Dispose of any shares to the extent such transaction would not cause the officer's share ownership to fall below his or her applicable requirement. The retention requirement applies both during and
after the Phase-in Period. If the officer does not attain compliance with his or her ownership requirement by the end of the Phase-in Period, any subsequent grants of equity
compensation to such officer will be payable solely in shares of stock until the ownership requirement is met. Under the Guidelines, the CEO may grant, on a case-by-case basis,
special dispensation for hardship, promotion, new hires, or other special circumstances.

  Summary Compensation Table        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table provides information concerning total compensation earned or paid to the Company's Named Executive
Officers, which consist of our CEO, Chief Financial Officer, our three other most highly compensated executive officers and Steven M. Wheeler, who retired in September 2010. The table provides
information for fiscal years 2008, 2009 and 2010; however, because Mr.&nbsp;Robinson was not a Named Executive Officer in 2008 and Mr.&nbsp;Falck was hired in July 2009, we are including
information for them only for 2009 and 2010. This table does not include the Supplemental RSUs because they were granted in 2011. The Supplemental RSUs are included in the Alternate 2010 Compensation
Table on page&nbsp;26 of this proxy statement.

 There were no forfeitures in 2010. 

2 These amounts represent the payments under the 2010 Incentive Plans described under "Executive
Compensation Components&nbsp;&#150; Annual Incentives" in the CD&amp;A on page&nbsp;27 of this proxy statement. Mr.&nbsp;Edington's amount for 2010 also includes: (i)&nbsp;$125,000 awarded
to Mr.&nbsp;Edington in connection with the 2010 Palo Verde Specific Compensation Opportunity described under "Narrative Disclosure" on page&nbsp;46 of this proxy statement; and (ii)&nbsp;$1,300
for incentive payments received in connection with the outage incentive plans for the 15th&nbsp;refueling outages for Palo Verde Units 1 and 3 during 2010 (collectively, the "Refueling Outages"). 

3 The amounts in this column for 2010 consist of: (i)&nbsp;the estimated aggregate change in the
actuarial present value from December&nbsp;31, 2009 to December&nbsp;31, 2010 of each of the Named Executive Officer's accumulated benefit payable under all defined benefit and actuarial pension

Mr.&nbsp;Falck&nbsp;&#150; $182,816; Mr.&nbsp;Robinson&nbsp;&#150; $2,166,888 (Mr.&nbsp;Robinson is currently eligible for retirement at a reduced retirement benefit; however,
this amount represents the amount he would be entitled to receive at age 60, at which time he would receive the full retirement benefit); and Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler&nbsp;&#150; $834,484 (this
amount is calculated based on Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler's retirement in September 2010); (ii)&nbsp;the above-market portion of interest accrued under the deferred compensation plan as follows:

"Narrative Disclosure" on page&nbsp;46 of this proxy statement. We describe the present value of Mr.&nbsp;Edington's accumulated benefit under the special agreement and our pension plans in the
2010 Pension Benefits table on page&nbsp;51 of this proxy statement.

1 In this column, the abbreviation "PS" means performance share awards and "RSU" means restricted stock
unit awards. 

2 The amount in this column represents the full grant date fair value for financial reporting purposes for
the 2010 Performance Shares and the RSUs. We describe the 2010 Performance Share and RSU awards under "Executive Compensation Components&nbsp;&#150; Long-Term Incentives" in the
CD&amp;A on page&nbsp;32 of this proxy statement. 

3 As required by SEC rules, the "Estimated Possible Payouts" represent the "threshold," "target," and
"maximum" payouts the Named Executive Officers were eligible to receive under the 2010 Incentive Plans, although any awards are subject to the discretion of the Human Resources Committee. The actual
awards paid to the Named Executive Officers under the 2010 Incentive Plans are disclosed in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table on
page&nbsp;41 of this proxy statement. With respect to Messrs.&nbsp;Hatfield, Edington, Falck and Wheeler, under the 2010 Incentive Plans, the minimum amount each officer would have been eligible
to receive was calculated based on APS earnings achieving the threshold amount, which would result in no payment with respect to the earnings portion of the 2010 Incentive Plans, and the business unit
results at the lowest possible award. See "Executive Compensation Components&nbsp;&#150; Annual Incentives" in the CD&amp;A on page&nbsp;27 of this proxy statement for additional information
about the 2010 Incentive Plans. 

4 This amount represents the 2010 Performance Shares described under "Executive Compensation
Components&nbsp;&#150; Long-Term Incentives&nbsp;&#150; Performance Shares" in the CD&amp;A on page&nbsp;32 of this proxy statement. In accordance with SEC rules, we valued
the awards based on the probable outcome at the time of the grant, which assumes the grant will be paid at 100% of the Base Grant and, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, the closing stock price on
the date of the grant. There were no forfeitures in 2010. 

5 This amount represents the 2010 RSU awards described under "Executive Compensation
Components&nbsp;&#150; Long-Term Incentives&nbsp;&#150; RSUs" in the CD&amp;A on page&nbsp;35 of this proxy statement. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, we valued the
RSUs using the number of RSUs awarded multiplied by the closing stock price on the date of the grant. There were no forfeitures in 2010. 


6 This amount represents the dollar value of the 2010 Palo Verde Specific Compensation Opportunity
described under "Narrative Disclosure" on page&nbsp;46 of this proxy statement. The actual amount paid to Mr.&nbsp;Edington is included in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation"
column of the Summary Compensation Table on page&nbsp;41 of this proxy statement. Under a similar incentive plan in place in 2009, Mr.&nbsp;Edington achieved the performance targets and received
the full amount available under that plan. Mr.&nbsp;Edington also achieved

performance
targets under the 2010 plan and received the full amount available under that plan. On this basis, the Company reflected the target amount as $125,000. 

7 These amounts represent the outage incentive plans for the Refueling Outages. These incentive plans do
not provide for a threshold or maximum payment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See
the CD&amp;A beginning on page&nbsp;19 of this proxy statement for further information regarding the terms of awards reported in the Summary Compensation Table and the Grants of
Plan-Based Awards Table, and for discussions regarding formula or criteria to be applied in determining the amounts payable, vesting schedules, and the treatment of dividends. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company does not have traditional employment agreements. We typically enter into offer letters with new executive officers. APS and Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield executed an offer letter
dated June&nbsp;17, 2008, pursuant to which Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield received the following: an annual base salary of $450,000; a hiring incentive of $200,000 that was paid to Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield during
the first two weeks of his employment in 2008, and $100,000 that was paid to Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield within two weeks of the first anniversary of his employment date in 2009; participation in the officer
annual incentive plan with a target payment of 50% and up to a maximum of 100% of annual base salary; an award of 1,400 performance shares which would have vested in 2009 (but did not pay out), an
award of 2,000 performance shares which would have vested in 2010 (but did not pay out), an award of 3,400 performance shares which vested in part in 2011; an award of 2,500 RSUs that vested through
February&nbsp;20, 2011, and an award of 3,500 RSUs that will vest through February&nbsp;20, 2012; participation in the Supplemental Excess Benefit Retirement Plan and the Deferred Compensation
Plan; relocation benefits; and a Change-in-Control Agreement similar to those provided to other executive officers. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;APS
and Mr.&nbsp;Edington executed an offer letter, dated December&nbsp;20, 2006, pursuant to which Mr.&nbsp;Edington received: an annual base salary of $600,000; a hiring bonus
of $200,000 that was paid to Mr.&nbsp;Edington during his first two weeks of employment, plus subsequent bonuses of $100,000 that were paid to Mr.&nbsp;Edington on employment anniversary dates in
2008 and 2009; participation in the annual incentive plan with a target of 50% and up to a maximum of 100% of annual base salary; an award of 10,000 retention units; annual grants of
long-term awards if made by the Human Resources Committee, with his first grant of performance shares to be in the amount of $125,000; cash payments made by APS on the dates on which
performance shares and stock options granted to Mr.&nbsp;Edington by his former employer would have vested, in an amount equal to the value of such stock grants; relocation benefits; and certain
medical benefits, including lifetime medical coverage for Mr.&nbsp;Edington and his spouse. In addition, the offer letter provides that his total pension benefit (including the benefit due under the
Company's qualified plan, general non-qualified plan, and the supplemental agreement discussed below) will be the greater of: (a)&nbsp;his total pension benefit if he had remained with
his former employer for five more years, or (b)&nbsp;a pension benefit that will accrue at 10% per year, up to a maximum of 60%, which will vest at five years of service. The percentage is applied
to his final average wage (highest 3&nbsp;years in the final 10&nbsp;years and includes both base salary and annual incentives) to determine his lifetime benefit. In addition, the retention units
granted to him in January 2007 are also included in the calculation of pension benefits. If his
employment is terminated for any reason other than voluntary resignation or termination for cause prior to meeting the vesting as indicated above, part&nbsp;(a) of this paragraph will become payable
to Mr.&nbsp;Edington or his spouse. If part&nbsp;(b) of this paragraph applies, it will be paid to Mr.&nbsp;Edington in two forms: one-half of the benefit will be paid to him in a
lump sum and the second half of the benefit will be paid to Mr.&nbsp;Edington in a 100% joint and survivor annuity. In addition, the offer letter provides that Mr.&nbsp;Edington will develop and
participate in Palo Verde incentive opportunities of up to $125,000, which is discussed for 2010 and 2011 in the following paragraph. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent
with Mr.&nbsp;Edington's offer letter, APS adopted the 2010 Palo Verde Specific Compensation Opportunity, which provided Mr.&nbsp;Edington the opportunity to receive up
to $125,000 upon the achievement of the following Palo Verde operational and performance targets: successful reaccreditation for all six operations programs and the engineering programs; the
achievement of a site

capacity
factor equal to or greater than 88%; no substantive cross-cutting issues; and no NRC colored findings by the end of 2010. Mr.&nbsp;Edington received a $125,000 award upon
Mr.&nbsp;Brandt's determination that the foregoing targets were met or exceeded. In December of 2010, APS adopted the 2011 Palo Verde Specific Compensation Opportunity, pursuant to which
Mr.&nbsp;Edington has the opportunity to receive up to $125,000 upon the achievement of specified Palo Verde operational and performance metrics. We do not believe that the specifics of this
opportunity, which is tied to 2011 performance, is necessary to an understanding of Mr.&nbsp;Edington's 2010 compensation. This opportunity will be described in our 2012 proxy statement. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
recognition of Mr.&nbsp;Edington's significant contributions to Palo Verde's improvement since he joined APS in early 2007 and his critical role in returning Palo Verde to
long-term excellence, on July&nbsp;18, 2008, APS and Mr.&nbsp;Edington entered into a letter agreement that provided as follows: 



&#149;Mr.&nbsp;Edington's base salary was increased to $800,000, effective June&nbsp;1, 2008.  &#149;APS entered into a separate deferred
compensation arrangement with Mr.&nbsp;Edington, pursuant to which APS credited
Mr.&nbsp;Edington's deferred compensation account with $1&nbsp;million, effective as of July&nbsp;15, 2008. APS will increase this account balance by an additional $1&nbsp;million on
June&nbsp;1 of each year beginning June&nbsp;1, 2009, until the account reaches $4&nbsp;million on June&nbsp;1, 2011. The account will vest on June&nbsp;1, 2012 if Mr.&nbsp;Edington
remains with APS and will be payable before that date upon Mr.&nbsp;Edington's death, disability, or involuntary termination.  &#149;Effective July&nbsp;15, 2008, APS established for
Mr.&nbsp;Edington a life insurance benefit of $3&nbsp;million that
decreases by $1&nbsp;million on June&nbsp;1 of each year, beginning June&nbsp;1, 2009, until the life insurance benefit terminates on June&nbsp;1, 2011. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December&nbsp;26, 2008, APS and Mr.&nbsp;Edington entered into a supplemental agreement further defining Mr.&nbsp;Edington's pension benefits as set forth in the
December&nbsp;20, 2006 letter, and the deferred compensation arrangement as set forth in the July&nbsp;18, 2008 letter. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinnacle
West and Mr.&nbsp;Falck executed an offer letter in May 2009, pursuant to which Mr.&nbsp;Falck received: a starting annual base salary of $450,000; hiring incentive
payments of $200,000 and $150,000 that were paid in 2009 and 2010; participation in the officer annual incentive plan with a target payment of 50% and up to a maximum of 100% of annual base salary; an
award of 8,580 performance shares ("Falck Grant 1"), which vested in part in March 2011 and will vest in the Fall of 2011 and an award of 13,000 performance shares ("Falck Grant 2"), which will vest
in 2012, if the performance criteria are met (the performance share grants were based 50% upon an earnings per share metric and 50% upon the six performance metrics specified on page&nbsp;34 of this
proxy statement); an award of 9,750 RSUs that will vest through February&nbsp;20, 2012 and an award of 13,000 RSUs that will vest through February&nbsp;20, 2013; participation in the Supplemental
Excess Benefit Retirement Plan and the Deferred Compensation Plan; a special discretionary credit award, which is described under "Discussion of Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" on page&nbsp;55
of this proxy statement; and a Change-in-Control Agreement similar to those provided to other officers but modified to include a three-year sunset on the excise tax
gross-up provisions; and relocation benefits. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;APS
and Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler entered into a letter agreement in June 2001, pursuant to which Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler was credited with twelve (12)&nbsp;years of service for purposes of
calculating his pension. As part of his September 2010 retirement, Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler and APS entered into an agreement (the "Wheeler Retirement Agreement") in recognition of his 37&nbsp;years of
service as legal counsel and as one of our officers, during which period he helped guide APS through some of the most challenging issues it faced. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler
received: (i)&nbsp;a special recognition payment of $650,000; (ii)&nbsp;an additional two years of service for pension purposes, resulting in increased retirement benefits of $442,769; and
(iii)&nbsp;the opportunity to receive an award under the APS Incentive Plan as if he was employed by APS through December&nbsp;31, 2010, resulting in an increased incentive payment of $97,514.
Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler provided APS with customary releases, confidentiality covenants, and an agreement to make himself available in connection with any present or future litigation involving APS or its
affiliates.

1 The amount in this column is calculated by multiplying the closing market price of our common stock at
the end of 2010 ($41.45 per share as of December&nbsp;31, 2010) by the number of RSUs and performance shares ("PS") listed for the specified officer. 


2 This amount represents the RSUs awarded in 2010 that are described, with their vesting and release
schedule, under "Executive Compensation Components&nbsp;&#150; Long-Term Incentives&nbsp;&#150; RSUs" in the CD&amp;A on page&nbsp;35 of this proxy statement. 

3 This amount represents the RSUs awarded in 2009. The 2009 RSUs vest and are released in 25% increments
beginning on February&nbsp;20, 2010, so that they will be fully vested on February&nbsp;20, 2013. 

4 This amount represents the RSUs awarded in 2008. The 2008 RSUs vest and are released in 25% increments
beginning on February&nbsp;20, 2009, so that they will be fully vested on February&nbsp;20, 2012. 

5 This amount represents the RSUs awarded in 2007. The 2007 RSUs vest and are released in 25% increments
beginning on February&nbsp;20, 2008, so that they were fully vested on February&nbsp;18, 2011. 

6 This amount represents the 2010 Performance Shares. SEC rules require us to assume a number of shares
equal to the 50th&nbsp;percentile payout level of the performance shares for the 2010 Performance Shares, although the actual number of shares awarded, if any, will not be determined
until after the end of the performance period, which ends on December&nbsp;31, 2012. The 2010 Performance Shares are described with their vesting schedule under "Executive Compensation
Components&nbsp;&#150; Long-Term Incentives&nbsp;&#150; Performance Shares" in the CD&amp;A on page&nbsp;32 of this proxy statement. 

7 This amount represents the performance shares issued in 2009. SEC rules require us to assume a number of
shares equal to the 50th&nbsp;percentile payout level of the performance shares for the 2009 performance shares, although the actual number of shares awarded, if any, will not be
determined until after the end of the performance period, which ends on December&nbsp;31, 2011. The 2009 performance shares have a performance period beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2009 and ending
on December&nbsp;31, 2011. 

8 This amount represents the remaining RSUs that were provided to Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield in 2008 pursuant to
his offer letter. The award of 2,000 RSUs will vest in 1,000 unit increments each February&nbsp;20 through February&nbsp;2012; the award of 1,000 RSUs fully vested on February&nbsp;18, 2011. 

9 The terms of the grants to Mr.&nbsp;Falck and their vesting dates are described under "Narrative
Disclosure" on page&nbsp;46 of this proxy statement. The 13,000 performance shares are tied to Falck Grant&nbsp;2. A portion of Falck Grant&nbsp;1 has vested and is reflected in the 2010 Option
Exercises and Stock Vested table on page&nbsp;50 of this proxy statement. The remaining portion of Falck Grant&nbsp;1 is reflected in the 4,290 performance shares reported in the table. The
performance period for the 4,290 performance shares ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, and is tied to the six performance metrics identified in the CD&amp;A on page&nbsp;34 of this proxy statement. SEC
rules require us to assume a number of shares equal to the 50th&nbsp;percentile payout level. We anticipate that on or about November&nbsp;30, 2011, the Company will have the
information needed to determine whether, and to what extent, these metrics were met. 

10 Mr.&nbsp;Robinson and Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler have RSUs that will be released as described in
footnotes&nbsp;2-5. Mr.&nbsp;Robinson and Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler are fully vested in these grants due to Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler's retirement and Mr.&nbsp;Robinson's qualification for early
retirement.

1 The amount in this column consists of: (i)&nbsp;retention units that were granted to Mr.&nbsp;Brandt
in December&nbsp;2006 and Mr.&nbsp;Edington in January&nbsp;2007 and that vested in part on January&nbsp;4, 2010 as follows: Mr.&nbsp;Brandt&nbsp;&#150; 2,756; and
Mr.&nbsp;Edington&nbsp;&#150; 2,500; (ii)&nbsp;RSUs that were granted to Messrs.&nbsp;Brandt, Hatfield and Edington in February&nbsp;2009 and Mr.&nbsp;Falck in July&nbsp;2009 that
vested and were released in part on February&nbsp;19, 2010 as follows: Mr.&nbsp;Brandt&nbsp;&#150; 7,438; Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield&nbsp;&#150; 875;
Mr.&nbsp;Edington&nbsp;&#150; 2,000; and Mr.&nbsp;Falck&nbsp;&#150; 3,250; RSUs that were granted to Messrs.&nbsp;Brandt and Edington in February&nbsp;2008,
Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield in October&nbsp;2008 and Mr.&nbsp;Falck in July&nbsp;2009 and that vested and were released, in part, on February&nbsp;19, 2010 as follows:
Mr.&nbsp;Brandt&nbsp;&#150; 3,313; Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield&nbsp;&#150; 1,000; Mr.&nbsp;Edington&nbsp;&#150; 2,000; and Mr.&nbsp;Falck&nbsp;&#150; 3,250; RSUs that
were granted to Messrs.&nbsp;Brandt and Edington in February&nbsp;2007 and to Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield in October&nbsp;2008 and that vested and were released, in part, on February&nbsp;19, 2010 as
follows: Mr.&nbsp;Brandt&nbsp;&#150; 2,500; Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield&nbsp;&#150; 1,000; and Mr.&nbsp;Edington&nbsp;&#150; 1,525; 11,788 RSUs that were granted (but were not
released) to Mr.&nbsp;Robinson in January&nbsp;2010; and 4,928 RSUs that were granted (but not released) to Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler in January&nbsp;2010; and (iii)&nbsp;performance shares that were
granted to Messrs.&nbsp;Brandt, Edington, Robinson and Wheeler in February&nbsp;2008, Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield in October&nbsp;2008, and Mr.&nbsp;Falck in July&nbsp;2009, and that vested in part
on March&nbsp;21, 2011, as follows: Mr.&nbsp;Brandt&nbsp;&#150; 11,207; Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield&nbsp;&#150; 2,876; Mr.&nbsp;Edington&nbsp;&#150; 6,768;
Mr.&nbsp;Falck&nbsp;&#150; 4,616; Mr.&nbsp;Robinson&nbsp;&#150; 2,961; and Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler&nbsp;&#150; 4,230. 


2 The values realized for the retention units, the RSUs and the performance shares are calculated by
multiplying the number of shares of stock or units released by the market value of the common stock on the release date, which: (i)&nbsp;for the retention units for Messrs.&nbsp;Brandt and
Edington was $36.88; (ii)&nbsp;for the RSUs for Messrs.&nbsp;Brandt, Edington, Falck and Hatfield was $37.37; (iii)&nbsp;for the RSUs for Messrs.&nbsp;Robinson and Wheeler was $37.54; and
(iv)&nbsp;for the performance shares for the Named Executive Officers was $41.91. Messrs.&nbsp;Robinson and Wheeler are treated as fully vested in the 2010 RSUs at the time of the grant because
under the terms of the grant, an individual becomes fully vested at the time the individual retires under the Company's retirement plan. Although fully vested, the awards will be released to
Messrs.&nbsp;Robinson and Wheeler in four equal, annual installments beginning on February&nbsp;20, 2011.

1 See Note&nbsp;8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Pinnacle West/APS Annual
Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 for additional information about the assumptions used by the Company in calculating pension obligations. 


2 The amounts shown are the present values of Mr.&nbsp;Brandt's accumulated benefits to be paid at
age&nbsp;65. 

3 The amounts shown are the present values of Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield's accumulated benefit to be paid as an
annuity or lump sum for the Retirement Plan and annuity to be paid under his Supplemental Plan. 

4 The amounts shown are the present values of Mr.&nbsp;Edington's accumulated benefits to be paid after
five years of service, the earliest time at which he could retire with no reduction in benefits. Mr.&nbsp;Edington is currently vested in the present value of his Retirement Plan and Supplemental
Plan benefits; however, if he were to leave the Company prior to retirement, he would not be entitled to benefits under the Supplemental Plan, but these amounts could be payable to him under his
employment agreement. With respect to Mr.&nbsp;Edington's agreement, see "Narrative Disclosure" on page&nbsp;46 of this proxy statement. 

5 The amounts shown are the present values of Mr.&nbsp;Falck's accumulated benefit. Mr.&nbsp;Falck is
not currently vested in the present value of his Retirement Plan or Supplemental Plan benefits. 

6 The amounts shown are the present values of Mr.&nbsp;Robinson's accumulated benefit to be paid at
age&nbsp;60, the earliest age at which he could retire with no reduction in benefits. 

7 Under the terms of this plan, as it applies to the Named Executive Officers, no additional benefit is
awarded for credited years of service over 25&nbsp;years of service. 

8 The amount shown is the present value of Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler's future benefits to be paid based on his
actual retirement election. His Retirement Plan benefits began October&nbsp;1, 2010. The supplemental and agreement benefits will start
payment on April&nbsp;1, 2011. The amount shown for his Agreements is the incremental value to Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler for his credited years of service. See "Narrative Disclosure" on page&nbsp;46 of
this proxy statement for a discussion of Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler's Agreements.

  Discussion of Pension Benefits        

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirement Plan and Supplemental Plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's Retirement Plan is a tax-qualified,
non-contributory retirement plan
for salaried and hourly employees. The Supplemental Plan provides retirement benefits for key salaried employees in addition to those provided under the Retirement Plan. The Supplemental Plan pays
only the difference between the total benefit payable under the Supplemental Plan and the benefit payable under the Retirement Plan. As a result, an executive who participates in the Supplemental Plan
does not receive duplicative benefits. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
to April&nbsp;1, 2003, benefits under the Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Plan (the "Traditional Formula Benefit") accrued in accordance with a traditional retirement plan
formula based on average
annual compensation and years of service (the "Traditional Formula"). Effective April&nbsp;1, 2003, the Company changed the benefit accrual formula for both the Retirement Plan and the Supplemental
Plan (the "Account Balance Benefit") to a retirement account balance formula (the "Account Balance Formula"). As part of the modification, all then current participants were able to elect to either
(a)&nbsp;continue to earn benefits calculated under the Traditional Formula, or (b)&nbsp;earn benefits calculated (i)&nbsp;under the Traditional Formula for service through March&nbsp;31,
2003, and (ii)&nbsp;under the Account Balance Formula for service after that date. Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler's benefits are calculated under the Traditional Formula. Messrs.&nbsp;Brandt's and Robinson's
benefits are calculated under the combined Traditional Formula/Account Balance Formula. Messrs.&nbsp;Hatfield's and Falck's benefits are calculated under the Account Balance Formula.
Mr.&nbsp;Edington's benefits under the Retirement Plan are calculated under the Account Balance Formula. His benefits under the Supplemental Plan are calculated in accordance with his employment
agreement with the Company, which is described under "Narrative Disclosure" on page&nbsp;46 of this proxy statement. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the Traditional Formula of the Supplemental Plan, a participant's monthly benefit for life beginning at normal retirement age (age 65 or age 60 with 20&nbsp;years of service) is
equal to the following: 



&#149;3% of the participant's average monthly compensation multiplied by the participant's first 10&nbsp;years of service,
plus  &#149;2% of the participant's average monthly compensation multiplied by the participant's next 15&nbsp;years of service, &#149;minus benefits payable under the Retirement Plan. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
participant's Traditional Formula Benefit under the Retirement Plan is a monthly benefit for life beginning at normal retirement age and is equal to the participant's average monthly
compensation multiplied by 1.65% for the first 33&nbsp;years of service, plus 1% of average monthly compensation for each year of service credited in excess of 33&nbsp;years. A participant's
Traditional Formula Benefit begins when the participant reaches age 65 with 5&nbsp;years of service or age 60 with 33&nbsp;years of service. The maximum Traditional Formula Benefit a participant
may receive under both the Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Plan is a monthly benefit of 60% of the participant's average monthly compensation. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
both the Supplemental Plan and the Retirement Plan, a participant may elect to begin receiving the Traditional Formula Benefit after attaining early retirement age, which is
defined as age 55 with 10&nbsp;years of service. The Traditional Formula Benefit of an individual who makes this election will be reduced to reflect the early commencement of benefits.
Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler qualified for early retirement under the Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Plan. Mr.&nbsp;Robinson currently qualifies for early retirement under the Retirement Plan and the
Supplemental Plan. They do not currently qualify for normal retirement under the Retirement Plan or the Supplemental Plan. Messrs.&nbsp;Brandt, Hatfield,
Edington and Falck do not currently qualify for early or normal retirement under either the Supplemental Plan or the Retirement Plan.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the Account Balance Formula, a notional account is established for each eligible participant and benefits are generally payable at termination of employment. The Company credits
monthly amounts to a participant's account. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the Supplemental Plan, Company credits are based on the following formula:

on age and years of service (with the maximum transition credit being equal to 2.75% of average monthly compensation).

purposes of calculating the Traditional Formula Benefit and the Account Balance Benefit under the Retirement Plan, compensation consists solely of base salary up to $245,000,
including any employee contributions under the Company's 401(k) plan, flexible benefits plan and qualified transportation arrangement under Section&nbsp;132(f) of the Internal Revenue Code. Amounts
voluntarily deferred under other deferred compensation plans, bonuses and incentive pay are not taken into account under the Retirement Plan. The Supplemental Plan takes these amounts into account
(with certain exceptions) plus base salary beyond the $245,000 limit. In addition, the retention units granted in December 2006 and January 2007 are included in compensation under the Supplemental
Plan. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of the Traditional Formula under the Retirement Plan, the average monthly compensation is the average of the highest 36 consecutive months of compensation in the final
10&nbsp;years of employment; under the Supplemental Plan, the average monthly compensation is the average of the highest 36 consecutive months of compensation during employment. For purposes of the
Account

Balance
Formula, contributions are based on the participant's then current monthly compensation calculated as described above. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
participant's years of service begin accruing on the date of employment. However, benefits do not vest until the completion of three years of service. The Company has from time to
time granted key executives additional years of service and/or additional benefits as a percentage of average monthly compensation under the Supplemental Plan when necessary and appropriate to recruit
and retain, and in limited situations, reward such executives. All such arrangements are pursuant to written agreements. Mr.&nbsp;Edington's employment agreement provides him with a benefit equal to
the greater of (a)&nbsp;an amount equal to his total pension benefit if he had stayed at his prior employer for five more years, or (b)&nbsp;a pension benefit which will accrue at 10% of his final
average pay per year of service, up to a maximum of 60% of his final average pay which will vest in June 2011, if Mr.&nbsp;Edington still is employed by the Company. If Mr.&nbsp;Edington
terminates employment for reasons other than voluntary resignation or termination for cause prior to June 2011, he is entitled to a monthly benefit of $24,226 payable for his life and the life of his
spouse. If Mr.&nbsp;Edington voluntarily resigns or is terminated for cause prior to June 2011, he is entitled to a benefit under the terms of the Supplemental Plan. Under the terms of our
arrangements with Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler, he received 14&nbsp;years of service for the purpose of calculating benefits under the Supplemental Plan. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
both the Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Plan, benefits are generally payable, as the participant elects, in the form of a level annuity, with or without survivorship, or a
lump sum. However, Traditional Formula Benefits generally are not available as a lump sum, but are paid in the form of an annuity. Optional benefit forms are of relative actuarial value under the
Retirement Plan. Under the Supplemental Plan, the 50% joint and survivor benefit form is fully subsidized, and the other benefit forms are partially subsidized. The Supplemental Plan offers an
optional five-year certain form of payment (payable in 60&nbsp;monthly installments). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective
January&nbsp;1, 2011, the Supplemental Plan was amended to reduce the Company credits for individuals who become participants on or after January&nbsp;1, 2011 to the
levels listed in the following table:

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, individuals who become participants in the Supplemental Plan on or after January&nbsp;1, 2011 are no longer entitled to receive a
fully subsidized 50% joint and survivor annuity form of benefit, but the 25-Year Cap has been eliminated. Prior to the amendment, participants who were promoted to officer status were
entitled to retroactive treatment as an officer for their entire period of employment. This feature has been eliminated for individuals promoted to officer status on or after January&nbsp;1, 2011. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits
under the Retirement Plan are paid from a tax-exempt trust. Benefits under the Supplemental Plan are paid from the general assets of the Company.

1 The amount of the executive contribution is solely from the voluntary deferral by the executive of the
executive's designated compensation and does not include any separate Company contribution. These deferred amounts are included in the "Salary" and "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation"
columns in the Summary Compensation Table on page&nbsp;41 of this proxy statement. 
2 A portion of the amounts reported in this column is also reported as compensation in the Summary Compensation Table on page&nbsp;41 of this proxy statement, including,
Mr.&nbsp;Brandt&nbsp;&#150; $33,010; Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield&nbsp;&#150; $1,148; Mr.&nbsp;Edington&nbsp;&#150; $28,799; Mr.&nbsp;Falck&nbsp;&#150; $11,767;
Mr.&nbsp;Robinson&nbsp;&#150; $12,618; and Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler&nbsp;&#150; $36,068. See clause&nbsp;(ii) of the first sentence of footnote 3 to the Summary Compensation Table on
page&nbsp;41 of this proxy statement. 
3 The historical contributions of each Named Executive Officer to his aggregate balance at December&nbsp;31, 2010, including "market rate" interest (as defined by the SEC) from the
date of each contribution, is as follows: Mr.&nbsp;Brandt&nbsp;&#150; $989,943; Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield&nbsp;&#150; $36,091; Mr.&nbsp;Edington&nbsp;&#150; $896,502;
Mr.&nbsp;Robinson&nbsp;&#150; $378,114; and Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler&nbsp;&#150; $1,105,527. Of the totals in this column,
the following amounts have previously been reported in the Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement on page&nbsp;41 or in the Company's prior proxy statements:
Mr.&nbsp;Brandt&nbsp;&#150; $895,137; Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield&nbsp;&#150; $35,148; Mr.&nbsp;Edington&nbsp;&#150; $861,529; Mr.&nbsp;Falck&nbsp;&#150; $15,384;
Mr.&nbsp;Robinson&nbsp;&#150; $179,844; and Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler&nbsp;&#150; $669,520. 
4 Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield will not be fully vested until December&nbsp;31, 2012. In the event Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield had left the Company on December&nbsp;31, 2010, his aggregate balance
would have been $35,414. 
5 Mr.&nbsp;Edington will not be fully vested under the 2005 Plan until December&nbsp;31, 2011, and he will not be fully vested in his deferred compensation pursuant to his agreement
until June&nbsp;1, 2012. In the event Mr.&nbsp;Edington had left the Company on December&nbsp;31, 2010, other than by reason of his death, disability, or involuntary termination without cause,
his aggregate balance would have been $875,877. We describe the agreement we have with Mr.&nbsp;Edington regarding his deferred compensation under "Narrative Disclosure" on page&nbsp;46 of this
proxy statement and under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control&nbsp;&#150; Deferred Compensation Plans" on page&nbsp;60 of this proxy statement.

6 Pursuant to Mr.&nbsp;Falck's offer letter, described under "Discussion of Nonqualified Deferred Compensation&nbsp;&#150; DCP and 2005 Plan" below, the Company made a
$350,000 credit award to Mr.&nbsp;Falck in 2009. The first $250,000 and interest accrued will vest on July&nbsp;29, 2014 and the remaining $100,000 and interest accrued will vest on
July&nbsp;29, 2016 as long as he is employed by the Company on those dates. 

 
 
  Discussion of Nonqualified Deferred Compensation        

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DCP and 2005 Plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective January&nbsp;1, 1992, the Company established The Pinnacle West
Capital Corporation, Arizona Public Service Company,
SunCor Development Company, and El Dorado Investment Company Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DCP"). Under the DCP, a participant who was an employee was allowed to defer up to 50% of annual base
salary and up to 100% of year-end 

-&nbsp;55&nbsp;-

bonus,
which would include awards under regular annual incentive plans, but not special incentive payments. A participant who is a member of the Board is allowed to defer up to 100% of the annual cash
fees (including retainer and meeting fees) payable to the participant. Amounts deferred by participants are credited with interest at various rates in substantially the same manner as interest is
credited pursuant to the 2005 Plan, as described below. Distributions may be made (i)&nbsp;within 30&nbsp;days after the fifth year an amount was deferred, (ii)&nbsp;on account of an unforeseen
emergency, (iii)&nbsp;on account of retirement after attaining age 65 with five years of service or after attaining age 55 with 10&nbsp;years of service ("Retirement Benefit"), (iv)&nbsp;on
account of termination prior to retirement ("Termination Benefit"), (v)&nbsp;on account of disability, or (vi)&nbsp;on account of death before termination of employment. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Retirement Benefit and Termination Benefit are payable in a lump sum or in 5, 10, or 15 equal annual installments, as elected by the participant. Other benefits are generally paid
in a lump sum. The
method of crediting interest on lump sum and installment payments under the DCP is substantially the same as the method used in the 2005 Plan, as described below. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December&nbsp;15, 2004, the Board authorized the adoption of a new nonqualified deferred compensation plan for post-2004 deferrals (the "2005 Plan"). No future
deferrals will be permitted under the DCP. The 2005 Plan, effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2005, is based in large part on the DCP as described above. The 2005 Plan was adopted to comply with the
requirements of Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue Code. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the 2005 Plan, a participant who is an employee is allowed to defer up to 50% of the participant's base salary and up to 100% of the participant's bonus, including regular awards
under annual incentive plans, but not special awards. A participant who is a member of the Board is allowed to defer up to 100% of the annual cash fees (including retainer and meeting fees) payable to
the participant. Amounts deferred by participants are credited with interest at various rates, as described below. Deferral elections of base salary and director's fees must be made prior to the
calendar year in which such base salary or director's fees will be paid. A deferral election with respect to a bonus must be made before the first day of the calendar year in which the bonus is
earned. When making a deferral election, a participant also makes an election regarding the time and form of the participant's distributions from the 2005 Plan. Distributions from the 2005 Plan must
be made in accordance with Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Distributions are made (i)&nbsp;in January of the fifth year following the year in which an amount was deferred,
(ii)&nbsp;on account of an unforeseeable financial emergency, (iii)&nbsp;on the later of termination of employment or attainment of age 55 (the "2005 Plan Termination Benefit"), or (iv)&nbsp;on
account of death before termination of employment. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
2005 Plan Termination Benefit is payable in a lump sum or in 5, 10 or 15 equal annual installments, as elected by the participant. Other benefits generally are paid in a lump sum. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the 2005 Plan, the Company uses two different interest rates to determine the amount of the participant's benefit. The first is the "Base Rate," which, for any calendar year, is
the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note rate published on the last business day of the first week of October preceding such calendar year. The second is the "Plan Rate," which is the sum of the
"Base Rate" and the "Supplemental Rate." The "Supplemental Rate" is determined by the plan committee appointed by the Board. During 2010, the "Base Rate" was 3.22% and the "Supplemental Rate" was
4.28%. 

-&nbsp;56&nbsp;-




 

Table of Contents

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a general rule, the interest rate used to determine the amount of the 2005 Plan Termination Benefit payable in a lump sum is as follows: 
 

















Years of Plan Participation



 
&nbsp;
Interest Rate



 


Less than Five (and termination occurs other than due to retirement and more than six months prior to change-in-control)
&nbsp;
Base Rate


 All other situations
&nbsp;
Plan Rate



 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interest rate used to determine the amount of the 2005 Plan Termination Benefit payable in installments is a fixed rate equal to the average
Plan Rate for the plan year in which the participant becomes eligible to receive the benefit and the four prior plan years. If the participant has fewer than five plan years of participation and
terminates employment for reasons other than retirement, the interest rate used to calculate installments is a fixed rate equal to the average Base Rate for the plan years of participation. If the
participant's installment payout begins on or after the date that is six months prior to a change-in-control of the Company, the Company is required to pay benefits using an
average of the Plan Rate for the plan years of participation. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective
January&nbsp;1, 2009, the Company amended the 2005 Plan to permit the Company, in its discretion, to award discretionary credits to participants. Discretionary credits
generally will be paid at the time and in the form provided in the written award agreement. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company agreed in Mr.&nbsp;Falck's offer letter to make a $350,000 discretionary credit award to Mr.&nbsp;Falck in 2009, pursuant to the 2005 Plan. The first $250,000 will vest
on July&nbsp;29, 2014 and the remaining $100,000 will vest on July&nbsp;29, 2016. The $350,000 discretionary credit award earns interest in accordance with the 2005 Plan. The full amount of the
discretionary credit award vests and becomes payable if the Company terminates Mr.&nbsp;Falck's employment without cause within two years following a change-in-control, or in
the event of his death. If Mr.&nbsp;Falck terminates employment, for any reason other than those discussed above, prior to July&nbsp;29, 2014, he forfeits the entire discretionary credit award; if
such termination occurs between July&nbsp;30, 2014 and July&nbsp;29, 2016, Mr.&nbsp;Falck forfeits $100,000. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation
in both the DCP and the 2005 Plan is limited to officers, the Company's senior management group and directors of the Company and participating affiliates. The Company's
obligations under the DCP and the 2005 Plan are unfunded and unsecured. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Deferred Compensation Arrangements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company agreed in Mr.&nbsp;Edington's letter
agreement to award him deferred compensation in
addition to any deferred compensation pursuant to the 2005 Plan. This award is described under "Narrative Disclosure" on page&nbsp;46 of this proxy statement and under "Potential Payments Upon
Termination or Change-In-Control&nbsp;&#150; Deferred Compensation Plans" on page&nbsp;60 of this proxy statement. 

 
 
  Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-In-Control        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section describes the potential payments that each of the Named Executive Officers could receive following
termination of employment, including through resignation, severance, retirement, death, disability, or a change-in-control of the Company (each, a "Termination Event"). We
describe plans, agreements, or arrangements under which each Named Executive Officer could receive payments following a Termination Event, excluding those that do not discriminate in favor of our
executive officers and that are available generally to all salaried employees ("Termination Plans"). The payments to the Named Executive Officers under the various Termination Event scenarios
described in this section are not intended to affect the Company's obligations to the Named Executive Officers. Those 

-&nbsp;57&nbsp;-




 

Table of Contents



obligations
are subject to, and qualified by, the contracts or arrangements giving rise to such obligations. Unless we note otherwise, the tables below assume that any Termination Event took place on
December&nbsp;31, 2010 for each Named Executive Officer other than Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler. The information below reflects the Company's payment obligations to Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler arising out of his
retirement from the Company on September&nbsp;30, 2010. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2010 Incentive Plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We describe the 2010 Incentive Plans under "Executive Compensation
Components&nbsp;&#150; Annual Incentives" on
page&nbsp;27 of this proxy statement. In connection with a Termination Event (other than for cause), each of the Named Executive Officers would have been entitled to receive the following:
Mr.&nbsp;Brandt&nbsp;&#150; $1,440,000; Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield&nbsp;&#150; $382,005; Mr.&nbsp;Edington&nbsp;&#150; $668,400; Mr.&nbsp;Falck&nbsp;&#150; $374,659;
Mr.&nbsp;Robinson&nbsp;&#150; $712,388; and Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler&nbsp;&#150; $393,642. In any event, the 2010 Incentive Plans provide that the calculation and the amount of award, if
any, to each officer, is in the discretion of the Human Resources Committee. As a result, the Human Resources Committee's determination may have been different had an actual Termination Event
occurred. In addition, Mr.&nbsp;Edington would have received $125,000 under the 2010 Palo Verde Specific Compensation Opportunity, if the performance criteria were met. We discuss the 2010 Palo
Verde Specific Compensation Opportunity under "Narrative Disclosure" on page&nbsp;46 of this proxy statement. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance Shares.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We describe performance shares under "Executive Compensation
Components&nbsp;&#150; Long-Term
Incentives&nbsp;&#150; Performance Shares" on page&nbsp;32 of this proxy statement. Any payment under the performance share awards is contingent on the Company attaining specified
performance criteria during the applicable performance period and, unless the Company attains such performance criteria, the executives may receive nothing from these awards. Performance shares
granted to Messrs.&nbsp;Brandt, Edington, Robinson and Wheeler in February
2008 and Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield in October 2008 paid out at the 42.3&nbsp;percentile ranking and a portion of the Falck Grant 1 paid out at the 53.8&nbsp;percentile ranking. As a result, the Named
Executive Officers received the following number of shares of common stock in connection with the payout: Mr.&nbsp;Brandt&nbsp;&#150; 11,207; Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield&nbsp;&#150; 2,876;
Mr.&nbsp;Edington&nbsp;&#150; 6,768; Mr.&nbsp;Falck&nbsp;&#150; 4,616; Mr.&nbsp;Robinson&nbsp;&#150; 2,961; and Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler&nbsp;&#150; 4,230. See
footnote&nbsp;9 to the 2010 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End table on page&nbsp;48 of this proxy statement regarding Falck Grant&nbsp;1. Messrs.&nbsp;Brandt, Hatfield, Edington and
Falck would not be entitled to a payout under the 2009 performance share awards or the 2010 Performance Shares in connection with a Termination Event. In the event of a Termination Event,
Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler, who has retired, and Mr.&nbsp;Robinson, who is eligible for retirement, would receive the following benefits:

1 Messrs.&nbsp;Wheeler and Robinson are entitled to receive stock payouts, if any, under the 2009
performance share awards and 2010 Performance Shares if the Company attains specified performance criteria for the three-year periods ended December&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2012, respectively,
because under the 2009 and 2010 award agreements, an employee is deemed to have been employed through the performance period if the employee retires after reaching the age of retirement and attaining
the requisite years of service. Assuming a 50th&nbsp;percentile payout level for the 2009 performance share awards and 2010 Performance Shares (see footnotes&nbsp;6 and 7 to the 2010
Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End table on page&nbsp;48 of this proxy statement), Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler would receive the following stock payouts in 2012 and 2013 (using the
closing market price on December&nbsp;31, 2010 of $41.45): $245,708 for 2012 and $243,727 for 2013; and Mr.&nbsp;Robinson would receive the following stock payouts in 2012 and 2013 (using the same
closing market price): $651,026 for 2012 and $582,958 for 2013.

1 Messrs.&nbsp;Wheeler and Robinson are treated as fully-vested under the outstanding RSUs awards
because Mr.&nbsp;Robinson qualifies for early retirement and Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler retired. 


2 If Mr.&nbsp;Robinson had retired effective December&nbsp;31, 2010, he would have been entitled to
receive $351,241 on February&nbsp;18, 2011 (using the closing market price on December&nbsp;31, 2010 of $41.45), and would be entitled to receive the following amounts on the
20th&nbsp;day of February 2012, 2013 and 2014 (using the same closing market price): $340,837 for 2012; $311,767 for 2013; and $151,257 for 2014. 

3 Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler retired from APS in September 2010. 

4 Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler is entitled to receive $220,742 on February&nbsp;18, 2011 (using the closing market
price on December&nbsp;31, 2010 of $41.45) and is entitled to receive the following amounts on the 20th&nbsp;day of February 2012, 2013 and 2014 (using the same closing market
price): $180,796 for 2012; $123,492 for 2013; and $63,233 for 2014. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirement Benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supplemental Plan is described in detail under "Discussion of Pension
Benefits" on page&nbsp;52 of this proxy statement.
The potential payment each Named Executive Officer may be entitled to receive, based upon the actuarial present value of each Named Executive Officer's benefits under the Supplemental Plan and the
related assumptions, are as follows:

1 Generally, all amounts assume (i)&nbsp;the Named Executive Officer died on December&nbsp;31, 2010,
(ii)&nbsp;the Named Executive Officer's Traditional Benefit is paid in the form of a monthly annuity to his spouse for life following his
death and that benefit payments commence immediately, and (iii)&nbsp;that the Account Balance Benefit is paid in the form of an immediate lump sum payment to his spouse. 

2 This amount assumes benefits are payable at age 65 and payable in 60 equal monthly installments. 

3 This amount assumes that benefits are payable in 60 equal monthly installments.

4 This amount reflects the $24,226 per month to which Mr.&nbsp;Edington is entitled (for his life and
the life of his spouse) pursuant to his agreement if his employment is terminated for any reason other than voluntary resignation or for cause prior to June 2011. If Mr.&nbsp;Edington voluntarily
resigns or is terminated for cause prior to June 2011, he is entitled to the benefit to which he would be entitled under the terms of the Supplemental Plan converted to an actuarially equivalent 100%
joint and survivor annuity for his and his spouse's lifetimes. 

5 This amount reflects the $24,226 per month payable to Mr.&nbsp;Edington's spouse, for his spouse's
lifetime, pursuant to his agreement in the event of his death prior to June 2011. 

6 This amount assumes election of early retirement on December&nbsp;31, 2010 and that benefits are
payable as a monthly annuity beginning January&nbsp;1, 2011. 

7 Mr.&nbsp;Wheeler retired from APS in September 2010. The amount reported represents the present value
of the lifetime monthly annuity beginning April&nbsp;1, 2011 under the Supplemental Plan and his agreements. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred Compensation Plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DCP and the 2005 Plan are described in detail under "Discussion
of Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" on
page&nbsp;55 of this proxy statement. As noted in footnotes&nbsp;1 and 3 of the 2010 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table on page&nbsp;55 of this proxy statement, each of the Named Executive
Officers has personally funded substantially all of the amounts in his DCP and 2005 Plan account. The combined account balance of each Named Executive Officer under the DCP and the 2005 Plan and his
distribution election are set forth below:

employment, with the balance paid out in annual installments over five years beginning on the date of termination. Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield only participates in the 2005 Plan. 

3 Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield would receive a lump sum payment of $8,938 and the balance payable in five annual
installments. 

4 Mr.&nbsp;Edington has elected to receive a lump sum distribution of $439,038 payable upon termination

5 Mr.&nbsp;Edington would receive a lump sum payment of $486,342 and the balance payable in five annual
installments. 

6 Amounts payable to Mr.&nbsp;Falck pursuant to the discretionary credit are discussed below. 

7 Mr.&nbsp;Robinson has elected to receive a lump sum distribution of $201,052 payable upon termination
of employment, with the balance paid out in annual installments over five years beginning on the date of termination. Mr.&nbsp;Robinson participates in both the DCP and the 2005 Plan.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming a Termination Event on December&nbsp;31, 2010 by reason of his disability or involuntary termination without cause,
Mr.&nbsp;Edington would receive a lump sum payment of $3,000,000 within 

-&nbsp;60&nbsp;-




 

Table of Contents



30&nbsp;days
after the Termination Event from a deferred compensation account that has been established in accordance with his letter agreement. Assuming Mr.&nbsp;Edington had died on
December&nbsp;31, 2010, his spouse would receive a lump sum payment of $4,000,000 in accordance with his letter agreement. The payments described in this paragraph are in addition to any
distributions to Mr.&nbsp;Edington pursuant to the 2005 Plan as set forth in the chart above. Mr.&nbsp;Edington's agreement is described under "Narrative Disclosure" on page&nbsp;46 of this
proxy statement. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with the discretionary credits awarded to Mr.&nbsp;Falck and described under "Discussion of Nonqualified Deferred Compensation&nbsp;&#150; DCP and 2005 Plan" on
page&nbsp;55 of this proxy statement, the full amount of the discretionary credit award vests and becomes payable if the Company terminates Mr.&nbsp;Falck's employment without cause within two
years following a change-in-control, or in the event of his death. Assuming Mr.&nbsp;Falck had died on December&nbsp;31, 2010, his spouse would receive the full amount of the discretionary credit
award. Mr.&nbsp;Falck would not receive payment of the award if any other Termination Event occurred on December&nbsp;31, 2010. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change-in-Control Agreements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has entered into identical Change-in-Control Agreements
with each of its executive officers, including each of the Named Executive Officers. The Company intends that these agreements provide stability in its key management in the event the Company
experiences a change-in-control. The agreements contain a "double-trigger" that provides for certain payments if, during the two-year period following a
change-in-control of the Company (the "first trigger"), the Company involuntarily terminates the officer's employment or the executive terminates his or her own employment
following a significant and detrimental change in the executive's employment (the "second trigger"). In case of an officer's retirement, death or disability, no payments are made under the officer's
Change-in-Control Agreement, except for the payment of accrued benefits; however, if the officer dies following the officer's receipt of a second trigger termination notice,
the officer's estate will receive the change-in-control payments the officer would have received if the officer had survived. Pursuant to the
Change-in-Control Agreement, each of the Named Executive Officers is obligated to hold in confidence any and all information in his possession as a result of his employment,
during and after the Named Executive Officer's employment with the Company is terminated. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
termination payment, if required, is an amount equal to 2.99&nbsp;times the sum of the executive's annual salary at the change-in-control as increased to
the date of termination plus the annual bonus (including incentive plan payments), as determined by an average over the last four years preceding termination. In addition, the executive is entitled to
continued medical, dental, and group life insurance benefits at a shared cost until the end of the second year following the calendar year of termination. The termination is treated as a normal
termination under the Company's stock option and benefit plans entitling the executive to exercise outstanding options within three months after termination and causing restrictions on restricted
stock to lapse. Outplacement services are also provided. If the limitations described in Section&nbsp;280G of the Internal Revenue Code are exceeded, the Company will not be able to deduct a portion
of its payments. In addition, if these limitations are exceeded, Section&nbsp;4999 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes an excise tax on all or part of the total payments. The agreement provides for
an additional gross-up payment equal to the excise tax (plus any penalties and interest) imposed on or with respect to the total payments. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
May 2009, the Company determined that, on a going forward basis, it will no longer provide excise tax gross-up payments in new and materially amended agreements with its
Named Executive Officers. In unusual circumstances where the Company believes that accommodations have to be made to recruit a new executive to the Company, limited reimbursement for taxes payable may
be included in an executive's contract; but even in those circumstances, the excise tax gross-ups will be subject to a three-year sunset provision.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A change-in-control under the Change-in-Control Agreement includes: (1)&nbsp;an unrelated third party's
acquisition of 20% or more of the Company's or APS' voting stock; (2)&nbsp;a merger or consolidation where either the Company or APS combines with any other corporation such that the Company's or
APS' outstanding voting stock immediately prior to merger or consolidation represents less than 60% of the voting stock of the Company or APS immediately after the merger or consolidation, but
excluding a merger or consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization in which no unrelated third party acquires more than 20% of the voting stock of the Company or APS; (3)&nbsp;a sale,
transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or APS to an unrelated third party; or (4)&nbsp;the case where the composition of either the Board of the
Company or of APS changes such that the members of the Board of the Company (the "Company Incumbent Board") or of APS (the "APS Incumbent Board"), as of July&nbsp;31, 2007 (and with respect to
Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield and Mr.&nbsp;Falck as of July&nbsp;31, 2008) no longer comprises at least two-thirds of the Company's or APS' Board of Directors. For purposes of this later provision, a person
elected to either Board after July&nbsp;31, 2007 (and with respect to the Change-in-Control Agreements for Mr.&nbsp;Hatfield and Mr.&nbsp;Falck, after July&nbsp;31,
2008), is treated as a member of the Company Incumbent Board or APS Incumbent Board if his or her nomination or election by shareholders was approved by a two-thirds vote of the members then
comprising the Company Incumbent Board or APS Incumbent Board, and it does not include anyone who became a director in an actual or threatened election contest relating to the election of directors. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
of the agreements terminates on December&nbsp;31st&nbsp;of each year upon six months advance notice by the Company to the officer; if the six months advance
notice is not given, the agreements will continue for successive one-year periods until the notice is given. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
benefits each of the Named Executive Officers would be entitled to receive following a change-in-control as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, are as follows:

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Severance Benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Falck is entitled to severance benefits under the terms of his offer
letter if the Company terminates his employment
without cause prior to July&nbsp;29, 2011. The severance benefits include continuation of his base salary in effect immediately prior to his termination date for a period of 12&nbsp;months
following his termination. Payments will be made in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices beginning 60&nbsp;days following Mr.&nbsp;Falck's termination. In addition,
Mr.&nbsp;Falck will receive a target bonus payment and a monthly payment equal to the amount of the Company-paid 

-&nbsp;62&nbsp;-

portion
of his health insurance premiums for a period of 12&nbsp;months following his termination. Mr.&nbsp;Falck will not receive these severance benefits if he is eligible for benefits under his
Change-in-Control Agreement. In addition, Mr.&nbsp;Falck must execute a
general release of claims against the Company to receive the severance benefits. Assuming Mr.&nbsp;Falck was terminated without cause on December&nbsp;31, 2010, he would receive $702,013, which
includes $459,000 as his base salary, $229,500 bonus based on target bonus of 50% of his base salary, and $13,513 health care benefits. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Agreements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to Mr.&nbsp;Edington's employment agreement, the Company established a
life insurance benefit of $3,000,000 for
Mr.&nbsp;Edington that decreases by $1,000,000 on June&nbsp;1 of each year, beginning June&nbsp;1, 2009, until the life insurance benefit terminates on June&nbsp;1, 2011. 

 
 
  OVERALL COMPENSATION PROGRAM    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Resources Committee has reviewed the Company's overall compensation program for its employees and has
concluded that its program is balanced and does not encourage imprudent risk-taking. Employee compensation consists of some or all of the components described in the CD&amp;A under "Executive
Compensation Components" on page&nbsp;24 of this proxy statement. The reasons why we believe our executive compensation program does not promote unacceptable risk-taking, as discussed in
the CD&amp;A under "Compensation Design" on page&nbsp;23 of this proxy statement, apply to our overall employee compensation program. 

 
 
  HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Human Resources Committee from January&nbsp;1, 2010 until May&nbsp;19, 2010 were
Messrs.&nbsp;Basha, Jamieson, and Lopez, Dr.&nbsp;Herberger, and Mses. Clark-Johnson and Grant, and from May&nbsp;19, 2010 until December&nbsp;31, 2010 were Messrs.&nbsp;Basha and Lopez,
Dr.&nbsp;Herberger and Mses. Grant and Munro. None of the members of the Human Resources Committee is or has been an officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and no executive
officer of the Company served on the compensation committee or board of any company that employed, or had as an officer, any member of the Human Resources Committee or the Board.

1 This amount includes fees paid to directors in connection with their service on the Board of the Company
and of one or more of the Company's subsidiaries. (See the discussion following this table.) In addition, with respect to Mr.&nbsp;Stewart, this amount includes $10,000 paid to him in connection
with his service for part of 2010 as the Board's liaison to the PVOC. 

2 In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 (formerly FAS&nbsp;123R), this amount reflects the aggregate
grant date fair value of the stock award. On July&nbsp;1, 2010, all of the directors at the time, other than Dr.&nbsp;Klein, received a grant of either common stock or RSUs, based on an election
previously delivered to the Company. All directors received common stock except for Mr.&nbsp;Gallagher, and Drs.&nbsp;Herberger and Cortese, who each received RSUs. Under the terms of the RSUs,
Mr.&nbsp;Gallagher and Dr.&nbsp;Herberger will receive one share of common stock for each RSU on the last business day of the month following the month on which they separate from service on the
Board, and Dr.&nbsp;Cortese received one share of common stock for each RSU on February&nbsp;1, 2011. The number of shares of common stock or RSUs granted was 1,994 and the grant date fair value
of each share of common stock or RSU is $36.17, which was the closing stock price on July&nbsp;1, 2010. Dr.&nbsp;Klein received a grant of 1,994 shares on July&nbsp;1, 2010. On
December&nbsp;14, 2010, the Human Resources Committee rescinded Dr.&nbsp;Klein's July grant. The rescission included 52 shares of stock purchased through the dividend reinvestment plan with
dividends paid to Dr.&nbsp;Klein on the stock granted. Concurrently, the Human Resources Committee issued Dr.&nbsp;Klein 2,045 RSUs. The RSUs will be settled in shares of common stock on the last
business day of the month following the month on which he separates from service on the Board. The grant of 2,045 RSUs includes 51 RSUs in respect of dividends on the Company's stock since
July&nbsp;1, 2010. Dr.&nbsp;Cortese also received an initial equity grant for new directors of 1,600 shares on January&nbsp;4, 2010, with a grant date fair value of $36.88 per share of common
stock. The new director equity grant was discontinued as part of the changes to the directors' compensation program, which are discussed following this table. The stock grants were not subject to
forfeiture.

3 The Company does not have a pension plan for directors. The amount in this column consists solely of the
above-market portion of annual interest accrued under a deferred compensation plan pursuant to which directors may defer all or a portion of their Board fees. See the discussion of the rates of
interest applicable to the deferred compensation program under "Discussion of Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" on page&nbsp;55 of this proxy statement. 

4 This amount represents an insurance premium for an accidental death and dismemberment policy that covers
all directors and officers. The amount has been pro-rated for Dr.&nbsp;Klein and Messrs.&nbsp;Jamieson, Post and Stewart to reflect the actual number of months served on the Board. The
remainder of the amount represents qualifying charitable contributions matched by the Company. (See the discussion following this table.) 


5 Mr.&nbsp;Brandt is a Named Executive Officer and his compensation is set forth in the Summary
Compensation Table on page&nbsp;41 of this proxy statement. Mr.&nbsp;Brandt did not receive any additional compensation during 2010 in connection with his service as a director. 

6 Messrs&nbsp;Jamieson, Post and Stewart retired from the Board effective May&nbsp;19, 2010. 

7 Dr.&nbsp;Klein joined the Board effective June&nbsp;1, 2010. 

 
 
  Discussion of Directors' Compensation        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Resources Committee makes recommendations to the Board for compensation, equity participation, and other
benefits for directors. The Human Resources Committee and the Board generally review director compensation every two years. In December 2009, following a review by the Human Resources Committee of
director compensation programs of other companies in the 2009 comparator group, management conducted a study of corporate board compensation and pay practices based on the 2009 comparator group
discussed in the CD&amp;A under "Setting Executive Compensation&nbsp;&#150; Consultant's Report and Comparator Group" on page&nbsp;20 of this proxy statement. The study demonstrated that,
overall, the directors' compensation was below the 25th&nbsp;percentile of the peer group. The Human Resources Committee's compensation consultant reviewed the study, validated the
methodology and supported management's recommendations. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a result, in January 2010, management proposed and the Board approved revisions to the director compensation program. The revised program positioned the directors' compensation
program at the median of the comparator group. The revised program eliminated board, committee and subsidiary meeting fees in favor of a flat retainer and simplifies the equity grants.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors have an option to either receive the stock grant on July&nbsp;1 or defer the receipt until a later date. A director who elects to
defer the receipt of stock will receive RSUs in lieu of the stock grant. A director who elects to receive RSUs may elect to receive payment for the RSUs in either (1)&nbsp;stock, or (2)&nbsp;50%
in stock or 50% in cash. The director may elect to receive these payments either (1)&nbsp;as of the last business day of the month following the month in which the director separates from service on
the Board, or (2)&nbsp;as of a date specified by the director, which date must be after December&nbsp;31 of the year in which the grant was received. The RSUs accrue dividend rights equal to the
amount of dividends the director would have received if the director had directly owned one share of our common stock for each RSU held plus interest at the rate of 5% per annum, compounded
quarterly. The dividends and interest are paid, based on the director's election, in either (1)&nbsp;stock, or (2)&nbsp;50% stock or 50% in cash. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only
non-management directors are compensated for Board service. Company directors also serve as APS directors for no additional compensation. The Company reimburses Board
members for expenses associated with Board meetings and director education programs.

  Director Stock Ownership Guidelines        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company believes that directors should have meaningful financial stakes in the Company to align their personal
financial interests with those of the Company's shareholders. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
January 2010, the Board adopted a revised stock ownership policy for non-management directors. Each director is required to hold or control Company common stock or RSUs
with a value of at least three times the annual cash retainer fee paid to directors. Directors will have until the later of January 2013 or three years following the date they become a director (the
"Director Ramp-Up Period") to reach the required ownership level. The Corporate Governance Committee has the discretion to grant a temporary waiver of the ownership policy to a director
due to financial hardship or other good cause shown. Using the closing stock price on December&nbsp;31, 2010 ($41.45), Messrs, Basha, Gallagher, Lopez, Nordstrom and Parker, Dr.&nbsp;Herberger and
Mses. Clark-Johnson, Grant and Munro currently hold the requisite number of shares. We expect that Drs. Cortese and Klein will hold the requisite number of shares at the end of the Director
Ramp-Up Period. 

 
 
  PROPOSAL 2&nbsp;&#150; ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") was
signed into law on July&nbsp;21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. public corporations to provide for an advisory (non-binding) vote on executive compensation
("Say-on-Pay"). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
discussed in more detail in our CD&amp;A beginning on page&nbsp;19 of this proxy statement and the accompanying tables and narrative, the Company has designed its executive
compensation program to align executives' interests with those of our shareholders, make executives accountable for business and individual performance, retain key employees, and attract, retain and
reward the executive talent required to achieve our corporate objectives and to increase long-term shareholder value. We believe that our compensation policies and practices are centered
on a pay-for-performance philosophy and, as such, are aligned with the interests of our shareholders. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
deciding how to vote on this proposal, the Board points out the following factors, many of which are more fully discussed in the CD&amp;A: 



&#149;Our Human Resources Committee has designed the compensation packages for our named executives to depend significantly on
the achievement of performance goals that the Committee believes drive long-term shareholder value;  &#149;The Company's performance in 2010, as discussed under "Overview of 2010 Company
Performance" on page&nbsp;19 of this
proxy statement;  &#149;As discussed on page&nbsp;23 of this proxy statement, our pay practices are designed not to encourage management to take
unacceptable risks;  &#149;We engage in significant benchmarking studies in order to confirm that our programs are comparable to the companies in our
Comparator Group; and  &#149;We believe the Company's executive compensation program is well suited to promote the Company's objectives in both the
short and long-term. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Board strongly endorses the Company's executive compensation program and recommends that the shareholders vote in favor of the following resolution: 






RESOLVED,
that the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in the CD&amp;A beginning on page&nbsp;19 of this proxy statement, the compensation tables
and the narrative discussion, is hereby approved.

Table of Contents










&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Human Resources Committee or the Board. However, we value our shareholders' opinions, and we will consider the outcome of
the vote when determining future executive compensation arrangements. 

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS
A VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  

  
 
      PROPOSAL 3&nbsp;&#150; ADVISORY VOTE ON FREQUENCY OF ADVISORY  SAY-ON-PAY VOTES    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dodd-Frank Act also requires U.S. public corporations to provide for an advisory
(non-binding) vote on the frequency of holding advisory Say-on-Pay votes. As such, the Company is presenting this proposal, which gives you as a shareholder the
opportunity to express your view on whether Say-on-Pay votes should occur every one, two or three years. You have the option to vote for any one of the three options, or to
abstain from the matter. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
discussed above, the Company has designed its executive compensation program to align executives' interests with those of our shareholders, make executives accountable for business
and individual performance, retain key employees and attract, retain and reward the executive talent required to achieve our corporate objectives and to increase long-term shareholder
value. The Board has determined that a three-year Say-on-Pay vote cycle is the best approach for the Company based on a number of considerations, including the
following: 



&#149;A three-year vote cycle will provide investors sufficient time to evaluate the effectiveness of our short and
long-term compensation policies and practices and the related performance of the Company;  &#149;A three-year vote cycle gives the Board and the Human Resources Committee sufficient time to
thoughtfully
respond to shareholders' sentiments, to implement any necessary changes to our executive compensation policies and practices and to evaluate the results of such changes before the next shareholder
advisory vote;  &#149;The rules of the New York Stock Exchange require the Company to seek shareholder approval for new employee equity
compensation plans and material revisions to them. This requirement provides our shareholders with the opportunity to provide additional feedback on important matters involving executive compensation,
even in years when Say-on-Pay votes do not occur; and  &#149;The Company expects to engage with shareholders on executive compensation during the period between the
Say-on-Pay votes as a regular part of its investor relations program. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar
to the Say-on-Pay vote, because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Human Resources Committee or the Board. However, we value our
shareholders' opinions and will consider the outcome of the vote in determining how often we will hold a Say-on-Pay vote. 

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS
A VOTE FOR A THREE-YEAR ADVISORY VOTE ON SAY-ON-PAY

      PROPOSAL 4&nbsp;&#150; RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF DELOITTE&nbsp;&amp; TOUCHE&nbsp;LLP  AS INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS OF THE COMPANY    

 
    Ratification        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee has selected D&amp;T as the Company's independent accountants for the year ending December&nbsp;31,
2011 and has directed management to submit such selection for ratification by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting. In the event the shareholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee
may reconsider this appointment. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent accounting firm at any time during
the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the Company's and the shareholders' best interests. 

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS
A VOTE FOR RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF DELOITTE&nbsp;&amp; TOUCHE&nbsp;LLP
AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2011  

  
 
      ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING MATTERS    

 
 
  The Independent Accountants        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee has selected D&amp;T, independent accountants, to examine the Company's financial statements for the
year ending December&nbsp;31, 2011 and, pursuant to Proposal 4, has requested shareholder ratification of this selection. D&amp;T served as the Company's independent registered public accountants for
the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2010. Representatives of that firm will be present at the Annual Meeting. These representatives will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and
will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 

 
 
  Audit Fees        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following fees were paid to D&amp;T for the last two fiscal years:

  Pre-Approval Policies        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee pre-approves each audit service and non-audit service to be provided by
D&amp;T. The Audit Committee has delegated to the Chair of the Audit Committee the authority to 

-&nbsp;69&nbsp;-

pre-approve
audit and non-audit services to be performed by D&amp;T if the services are not expected to cost more than $50,000. The Chair must report any pre-approval
decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. All of the services performed by D&amp;T for the Company were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. 

 
 
  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with its written charter adopted by the Board, the primary function of the Audit Committee is to assist
Board oversight of: (a)&nbsp;the integrity of the Company's financial statements; (b)&nbsp;the independent accountants' qualifications and independence; (c)&nbsp;the performance of the Company's
internal audit function and independence; and (d)&nbsp;general compliance by the Company with legal and regulatory requirements that may have a material impact on the financial statements of the
Company. 

The
Audit Committee reports as follows: 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Audit Committee has discussed and reviewed the audited financial statements of the Company as of and for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, with the
Company's management and the independent accountants, D&amp;T. The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the oversight of the Company's independent accountants. Management is responsible for the
Company's financial reporting process, including the Company's system of internal controls, and for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. The independent accountants are responsible for auditing and rendering an opinion on those financial statements, as well as auditing certain aspects of the Company's
internal controls. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor these processes. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Audit Committee has discussed with D&amp;T all communications required by auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and SEC regulations,
including those described in Statement on Auditing Standards No.&nbsp;61, as amended, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule&nbsp;3200T. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Audit Committee has obtained from D&amp;T and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the Public Accounting Oversight
Board regarding the independent accountants' communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. The Committee discussed with D&amp;T any relationships that may impact D&amp;T's objectivity and
independence and satisfied itself as to the accountants' independence. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
on the foregoing, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board that the Company's audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on
Form&nbsp;10-K for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, for filing with the SEC.
